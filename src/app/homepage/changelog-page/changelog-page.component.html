  <h1>Changelog</h1>
  <p>Here you can see a timeline of updates to this website! I often make small updates, for example when a new Nintendo soundtrack comes out or if I went to see a new film. For those I used to just say something like 'content update', although I save that stuff for the newsletter these days. You'll also find when I make new features and major updates.</p>
