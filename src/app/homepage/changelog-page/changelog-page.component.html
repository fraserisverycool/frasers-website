  <h1>Changelog</h1>
  <p>Here you can see a timeline of updates to this website! I often make small updates, for example when a new Nintendo soundtrack comes out or if I went to see a new film. I won't put those updates here. This is for new features, major content updates, that kind of thing. Originally I was gonna set up an RSS feed to deliver updates that way, but I decided that was too much work so if you wanna see what new stuff I've made, this page will have to do!</p>
