      <p>Here are some of my favourite albums. I've already put like 200 albums on here, and I intend to write some words about each of them, but I'm taking my time with that for now. Still, you can pick up some recommendations here.</p>

      <p>Have you heard about the Nintendo music app? It's so good! Yeah there isn't a huge selection of soundtracks on there just yet, they're dropping new ones every week and I'm so hooked. I'm writing a review for each one they release.</p>

      </button>
      <p>Talking about video game music, over the years I made a bunch of mixes of my favourite tracks. They are currently not available for download because I need a bit of time to figure out how to host these files on my raspberry pi. But I've already written a bunch of stuff about them if you wanna read.</p>
