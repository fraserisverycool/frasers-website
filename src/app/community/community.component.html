    <h2>D Kicker</h2>
    <p>My friends Marta and Victor have made a table football where instead of normal football players, you play with little penises! It's a lot of fun and very cute. It was created with a question in mind: what's going on with masculinity these days? Why do we want to compare ourselves all the time?</p>
    <p>You can learn more about D Kicker on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/d.kicker.cm/">instagram</a></p>
