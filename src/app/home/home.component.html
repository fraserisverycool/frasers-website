  <p class="lead text-center">Welcome to my list of games I played in 2024! I've now done this for five years, which means it's officially a tradition. I've even spruced up the website for it a bit. I hope you like it!</p>

    <h2>UFO 50 (PC)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 10/10</p>
    <p>Holy crap, is this game real? Dear visitors to this website, please consider dropping everything and buying this collection of 50 arcade games for the low price of 20 euros. You have to understand, this isn't just any old collection of NES/arcade-style games, these are all brand-new games! They've been developed with modern game design philosophy and ALL of the games are bangers. All 50 of them!</p>
    <p>This collection has everything: platformers, puzzle games, action games, top down strategy, RPGs, and plenty of wacky, hard-to-define-genre games as well. Each of them bring something new to the table, to the point where most of them could be expanded into their own indie games and they would be fucking great. Inevitably, not every game will be for everyone, but that's the beauty of UFO 50 - everyone can find something that suits their tastes in there, and everyone will also end up trying out different kinds of games that they would otherwise never touch.</p>
    <p>Personally I love puzzle games so I was delighted when the very first game I picked happened to be a block puzzle game called Block Koala. I got so into block koala and although I recognise why most people wouldn't rate the game very high, I totally clicked with it and very quickly 100%ed it. Camouflage was another banger puzzle game, so good.</p>
    <p>Other highlights for those who are interested were definitely Rail Heist, Vainger, Mortol 2, Night Manor, Party House and Hyper Contender. Block Koala still #1 though, maybe it's because it was the first one I picked. Feels like Block Koala and I have a special bond.</p>
    <p>One last thing I wanted to point out: this game has a huge and incredible chiptune soundtrack! Many of the tracks are even microtonal, which is something you hear almost never in video games. Hugely inspired and hugely inspiring. I couldn't pick a single recommendation so enjoy the banger start-up music:

    <h2>Void Stranger (PC)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 10/10</p>
    <p>Wow this game is the best puzzle game I've ever played. There is so much going on it's insane! It may look like a Gameboy game but let me tell you it is the most engaging game ever, not just for its satisfying puzzling gameplay. It's also absolutely drowned in secrets, lore, amazing characters, twists and turns, and 10/10 music.</p>
    <p>Similar to Outer Wilds or Tunic, you'll want to go into this game blind! Because you can progress using knowledge and skills, not with power ups or stuff like that. As you first start making your way through the puzzles, you will be blind to all the things on your screen. But at some point something will click and you'll have a moment where you say to yourself ‘hold on… there's more to this than I thought'.</p>
    <p>The vibe is on point. The music is so good. Please listen to the music of the first area. It, like many tracks, loops only after a very long time, and goes through many stages and sections, never getting boring. The imagery in the game is insane too.</p>
    <p>If you play it, please send me a message and we can talk about how good it is together!</p>

    <h2>Balatro (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 9/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 10/10</p>
    <p>Holy crap I finally did it, I found a game that lives up to Slay the Spire. Now that I finally beat the heart on A20 which every character, I felt good about putting StS down and it was around this time that I picked up Balatro. It's so addicting. I love getting exactly the right card you need for the moment. The higher difficulties are super hard! I know I'm going to be playing this for a long time… at least until Slay the Spire 2 comes out next year.</p>
    <p>I'm also into the hypnotic music that plays - they really made a great vibe with the game too. It's great because I enter in an obsessive trance, just looking for the the numbers to go higher and higher as my eyes glaze over.</p>

    <h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 9/10</p>
    <p>Holy moly is this a dream come true? I loved this game when I was younger and they've only gone and made it even better. The first and most important thing to talk about is the insane glow-up that the soundtrack got. It has truly gotten the Origami King treatment and I mean that in the best possible way. They've added new tracks, new variations of existing tracks, and boldly updated the old favourites which is almost always tasteful and successful. The battle theme has multiple variations depending on the region you're in and it's touches like that which turn a good game into a special game. You're in a mysterious off-colour forest and run into an enemy? Consider the vibe MATCHED.</p>
    <p>I will say that they added an Erhu (a very recognisable Chinese string instrument) to the Glitz pit music and it honestly sounds a bit off. In my opinion they should have gone for more of a lucha libre/WWE vibe but whatever it still sounds good.</p>
    <p>Another amazing update is the new expressions and animations all the characters have. Still the same as the original and yet injected with flair and love and care. Gameplay-wise they nerfed Power Bounce which thinking about it is probably a good thing. Some of the later boss battles can't be cheesed with it anymore.</p>
    <p>The OG game is so strong that you really can't go wrong and yet still my expectations were exceeded. The locations, the characters, the humour, the VIBE, it's all great, and absolute bonus it's a lot of fun to play too.</p>
    <p>I loved beating this game. I don't have the time that I used to for these things so I did it in little bursts. I even completed chapter 6 while on an overnight train! And beating the final boss was difficult just like I remember, but this time you can skip the cutscenes!!</p>

    <h2>Metroid Fusion (Gameboy Advance)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 8/10</p>
    <p>Compared with other Metroid games this one is different but the same. The same because you're metroidvania-ing around just like Zero mission or Super Metroid, fighting similar bosses, living your normal life. Gameplay-wise I did think to myself, this game is just like the others. But that's not a bad thing, it's a great formula.</p>
    <p>What it does differently is the vibe. This game is way more of a horror game than other ones - you can see where the blueprint for Metroid Dread is. There are some genuinely horrible & creepy moments. The first time you see the SA-X, or when you encounter a certain someone encased in ice, the introduction of one of the bosses towards the end where you first see its corpse… It's so good. Terrifying. The music really adds to it as well.</p>
    <p>It's way more linear in the sense that this computer tells you what to do at any point but I really appreciated that because I didn't enjoy in Super metroid how sometimes you had to decide on your own to go to a completely different sector to progress. It still left many things open in many cases so I still felt super smart finding my way around a lot of the time. There were like two points where I had to look up the answer because to be fair it was completely ridiculous. This one hole you have to find in the water sector is just so dumb, and the comments on the youtube video which shows the whole made me feel better about looking it up.</p>

    <h2>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 9/10</p>
    <p>Story: 9/10</p>
    <p>Daaaaamn this game is wild! It's a visual novel unlike any other, and honestly worth checking out for the innovative way it tells a story alone. You have 13 whole-ass protagonists who all have intricately interconnected lives and stories, and you get to follow all their journeys in any order you like. Octopath Traveler, eat your heart out! Unlike that stiff storytelling with 8 entirely separate stories, hear all the characters interact and it is so exciting. I admit that it relies on some of those classic anime tropes a lot, but I allow it because the actual story is so wild and unpredictable. It's got all these great plot twists and because you decide what order to learn about them, discovering them makes it feel like YOU figured it out, or that you stumbled onto some juicy information that you shouldn't have found already. Delicious.</p>
    <p>It also has some real time strategy gameplay to mix up all the dialogue scenes which looking back were quite refreshing and nice. I didn't enjoy it so much when playing them, especially at the start, but actually they weren't too bad, and by the end I was getting quite good at it. Focus of this game is on the incredible and absolutely wild story though. Highly recommended.</p>

    <h2>Animal Well (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 8/10</p>
    <p>This game has such a strong vibe it's insane. Everything is bioluminescent and dripping with water and it just looks so fucking rad. I love that you play as a tiny blob which can neatly fit through every gap. It's very polished and I respect that (just before this I played Cassette Beasts which is a bit of a technical mess so the contrast was there).</p>
    <p>This game has little to no background music which shocked me at first, because I am a lover of video game music. But it didn't take long for me to understand that that is crucial to the vibe of the environment. The sound design is super good even without the music - there is so much going on in terms of water dripping sounds, ambient noises, squelchy sounds as you move, it makes it all sound so real. And without the music it does give it that lonely metroid vibe. And on the occasions where music does play, it hits hard because of it. Interesting choice and although I'm a little upset because I'm sure a game with this vibe and colour scheme would have a beautiful twinkly soundtrack, I understand that not having music goes a long way to set this game apart from all the other super similar metroidvanias.</p>
    <p>This game is super similar to other metroidvanias, like it gave me heavy Axiom Verge vibes, which isn't a bad thing. It's got some very creative power-ups which are delightful, and focuses more on puzzle solving than combat, which I personally really appreciate. But there's another game which this clearly takes lots of inspiration from: Fez. Fez is this puzzler (also with a strong vibe) which you play through once, then it slowly dawns on you, that was just the beginning, and you are assaulted with many higher-level meta puzzles which turn the whole game on its head. Tunic was kinda similar too. Animal Well has the same thing going for it - you beat the game, and realise huh, there's more to it than this… you start digging and keep digging, and by the time you've reached some of the “deeper” parts of the well, you've already made a whole bunch of notes and are starting to go a bit crazy. I love that shit.</p>

    <h2>Penny's Big Breakaway (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 9/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 7/10</p>
    <p>I was drawn to this game because of its colour scheme of all things. Everything is saturated in blue which gives it a very special vibe. It's the colours you see first thing when you wake up in the morning when you're still woozy and coming to. It reminds me of this game I played as a child “Zool 2” in terms of vibe. Something very special!</p>
    <p>I do feel like the character of Penny is a bit random. Her design is just a bunch of elements thrown together and doesn't have so much of a personality. There is some missed potential there, especially with the “big breakaway” part of the game. It doesn't feel like you're running away, but rather like you're going through some levels. If it were me, I would have gone for Penny running away constantly, with animations reflecting her fear/excitement, kinda like in Pizza Tower.</p>
    <p>The game itself is pretty fun, it's a momentum game kinda like Sonic, which makes sense because it's from the same devs as Sonic Mania (one of the best games ever). And by the end of the game I kinda got it with the loop, dash and jump moves. At the start though it was really hard, and I kept hitting walls and being bad and it was frustrating. I didn't feel the need to replay levels and do them better.</p>
    <p>One thing about the game is that you can choose whether you go through slowly and find all the collectibles and unlock difficult levels, go for mega points by having a big combo, or speedrunning. Different strokes for different folks but I was totally unsure about what I wanted! I wish I could have been told what to do in that regard, but that's just me.</p>
    <p>One last thing: I regret playing this on the switch. The graphics and framerate are bad and not in a good way. When I watched some gameplay from the PC version after finishing the game I was so shook!</p>

    <h2>Thank Goodness You're Here (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Story: 7/10</p>
    <p>I heard about this game having good british humour so I found one of my few actual british friends at around 4:20pm and blazed through this game and it was so fucking funny. I do feel like the average German won't enjoy the vibe as much as we did but let me tell you we were in absolute stitches. The game itself is pretty bad, like it's just walking around trying to figure out what to do by prodding everything, but that's made up for by the outrageous nonsense happening on screen all the time.</p>
    <p>But yeah I do recommend it, the writing is genius and it's pretty cheap.</p>

    <h2>Harold Halibut (Xbox Gamepass)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 7/10</p>
    <p>My neighbour Fab and I enjoy playing indie games together when we hang out and this year we played a visual novel called Harold Halibut which he had on his gamepass. It was a nice time! The main thing to note about it is the stop motion/clay animation style. It gives it a vibe of being somewhat of a parody, like Team America or something. It means even the serious parts you have to enjoy with a smile. This combined with some honestly excellent dialogue makes for a delightful little experience.</p>
    <p>You play as a very plain and boring person who has a heart of gold, and he is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades handyman on a spaceship that is stuck in the sea of an alien world. All his colleagues speak down at him but in a loving way, and it's fun to see him deal with that. It's presented in a way that he might be depressed, but then he does find pleasure in the little interactions, because there are many delightful little quirks in the story to enjoy. After some twists in the story, you can see how his outlook changes, and it's handled quite maturely.</p>
    <p>It's got a nice little soundtrack, a lovely setting, and great characters. I really recommend it, although not if you're looking for a game. This is a visual novel through and through, you will only be pressing A!</p>

    <h2>Punchout (NES)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 8/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 7/10</p>
    <p>As part of my continued effort to play, complete and truly understand the games that all the smash characters came from, I took it upon myself to beat Punchout on the NES. This game is good, has aged very well, and is really hard. I haven't beaten it yet, but goddamn it I will. I wanted to get it done before I post this list but I can't get past Bald Bull, who is about halfway through the game. I have a long journey ahead of me...</p>

    <h2>Cobalt Core (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 9/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 4/10</p>
    <p>I heard about this game from a list of recommendations by Lena Raine for games with great soundtracks and yes, I love the music:</p>
    <p>

      </a>
    </p>
    <p>This is just the same as slay the spire. Instead it's got cute animals and great dialogue. One thing really nice about it is you play as three characters at once and get access to all three of their card decks, which means it's fun to pick and choose what you want.</p>
    <p>But it's definitely not as deep as slay the spire, and I wish it had an ascension system instead of just four difficulty modes. I also wish there were more obvious goals to complete in the game, instead of just winning 18 runs to unlock these dialogues.</p>
    <p>It was fun learning what was really broken in the game and what could be ignored. Like in slay the spire, card draw is super important, but in this game not so much - I would say energy is way more important. Also, movement is far more powerful than shielding. Pretty cool.</p>

    <h2>Dave the Diver (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 10/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 3/10</p>
    <p>This game is so kooky and fun, and made with love. It has a great art direction, and fantastic characters. You play a larger man who dives in a special location which contains all the fish in the world and then sells them as sushi. It's a wild premise and one that I really enjoy. I love that you just get real life fish and literally everything can be eaten. Even the bosses are just sharks and shit (for the most part).</p>
    <p>Dave the character is just great, he is often sidelined and people are kinda rude to him but he just takes it in his stride. He loves what he does and has a great positive mindset and you just love to see it. He's surrounded by some other amazing characters, like the sushi chef. Their little dialogues are always great, and all the characters are beautifully characterised by these amazing short pixel art cutscenes. They are SUCH a pleasure to watch always.</p>
    <p>Going diving and catching new fish is also super fun. First time to see and catch a shark? Awesome. And the sushi restaurant parts are also great. They're super satisfying and making more and more money each day just feels so good.</p>
    <p>But I don't think I'd recommend this game to friends, because it is just sooooo slow. Diving in general is slow, and the story progresses really slowly. There are a million side quests, including this eco-app where you are encouraged to collect certain items. You get so little out of these quests, but I found myself obsessively getting everything all the time. It's meant to be a relatively chill game but I found myself optimising and making sure I could complete everything, which resulted in a bunch of super long dives.</p>
    <p>As the game goes on, it continuously piles on new mechanics, minigames, stuff that is clearly designed to keep you interested, as the core gameplay of shooting your harpoon at fish will get old quick. That's cool and all but by the end you have so much shit on, that it's almost overwhelming. I spent more time farming, transferring fish from the fish farm, asking myself which recipes I wanted to upgrade, playing these dumb phone minigames than actually diving. They just cram the game full of new content, and it's not even good. Like each new mechanic is so shallow that it gets old very quickly.</p>
    <p>This fucking phone game which is like tamagotchi was what did it for me. Like why am I spending my time on this. They literally give you a phone that you can check for all the various game content, including a sushi version of instagram, and you end up just staring at it for ages. I truly don't think this game is a comment on how we are addicted to our phones. I just think they put too much shit into the game and it got boring. This would have been way better on a smaller scale in my opinion.</p>

    <h2>Chained Echoes (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 6/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 5/10</p>
    <p>I was recommended this JRPG and was kinda feeling like playing a good one after being disappointed by Sea of Stars, and although I recognise that this is good, I wasn't able to finish it.</p>
    <p>It's got plenty of interesting characters, and you play as lots of different constellations of them, and the world seems interesting, and the music good. I just felt like playing it was work and coming back into it after a break was really hard. Maybe it's because I was also playing Balatro at this time and I just always wanted to play that instead.</p>

    <h2>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 3/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 8/10</p>
    <p>I've got a lot to say about this one so buckle up. As an enjoyer of the original FF7 and… I think I was an enjoyer of the previous game (Final Fantasy VII Remake), I felt the desire to play this game too. But I've been shocked by how horrifically sanitised it is. I think Remake was much the same but here it's even more so! I realised pretty quickly during this game that I'm not actually playing a game, I'm playing a product. I'm being served content and I'm supposed to enjoy it. After all this is a triple AAA big budget game that I paid full price for, and consumers like me have certain expectations. So the game gives me open world, generous dollops of fan-service, a whole ass card game, one thousand million mini games, a whole bunch of playable characters (including big seph), orchestral remixes of beloved old songs…</p>
    <p>It just all feels so forced! You can't escape it. Sure, this game has magic and love but it all stems from the very strong base of the original game. The world of FF7 is so fucking cool, with the world being overtaken by an energy company after they monopolise a new environment-destroying energy source. It's so topical, I love it. Seriously, play the original, it still holds up today and tells such a cool story about this fascinating world (a whole-ass planet, by the way). Rebirth isn't bad as such because it's built on this base. But what it adds is either annoying, superfluous or made without love.</p>
    <p>The worst offender is the open world. Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind an open world. But this one is less of an open world and more of a to-do list of pointless tasks in a big area. I have to go to the various spots and complete menial tasks in order to get a rush of dopamine as it is ticked off. Most aggravating for me was Chadley, the AI robot child character who sends Cloud off to do these super scripted “I'm playing a video game” tasks. Go defeat these monsters, go take a photo here, go activate this tower. What do I actually get out of this? Luckily I'm not actually invested enough in the gameplay to be interested in the materia you get from Chadley.</p>
    <p>One thing the open world does do is give the sense that you're exploring the whole planet. And I have to say it looks quite nice. The various towns all look fantastic as well. This is really a feast for the eyes, especially for those who played the original. Seeing Costa del Sol, Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon all looking so good is a treat. There are also lush, orchestral versions of the original soundtrack in these places, which is delightful.</p>
    <p>But while I'm talking about the soundtrack, I have to say that it's all over the place. The general vibe appears to be orchestral, but then it throws in the wacky stuff (certain sidequests, chocobo music, moogles, cactuars…) and the music goes all electronic and wild. There is also gratuitous jazz music here and there, and other random shit depending on what's going on. It feels like they're just cramming in as much content as possible. This is a recurring theme.</p>
    <p>Similar topic, this game switches from serious to silly so casually, it's jarring. The chocobos really are completely ridiculous! And there's something about seeing them in HD which makes it even wilder. In the OG, things happen so quickly and switch themselves up so regularly and you don't even bat an eyelid if you need to ride a chicken through the swamp. The vibe is so strong that silly things can coexist with the serious main story. In this remake, the silly, cartoonish things simply look so out of place, I can't take anything seriously.</p>
    <p>Two of the main characters (Red 13 and Cait Sith, my fave from the OG) are so outlandish in this game that it takes away any hopes of seriousness when they're involved. Actually despite that, I'm super happy with how they did Cait Sith because that really isn't easy to translate from the PS1 version and he looks and sounds great. Red 13 though, god the thing with his voice in Cosmo Canyon is so dumb, and he doesn't have any personality apart from that. He was way cooler in the OG I can't even describe. As for the other characters, Aerith and Barret are fine, they're both delightful. Tifa I can't even say anything because any semblance of a personality is completely eclipsed by her humongous knockers. Those badockadonks have their own field of gravity they are that huge. Whenever she's on screen I can't help but make an out-loud comment about how needlessly massive her tits are. Yuffie is beautifully animated, but her outfit from the original really needed an update. She's really a ninja, and trying to make a sleeveless, crop-top, turtlenecked, knitted woollen jumper work.</p>
    <p>The worst offender though is Cloud. God I hate how useless he is in social situations. They made him stand-offish and distant so that he looks like a badass, but to me he's just a dickhead. Aerith is trying so hard to make conversation and she is just suffering because Cloud just leaves her on read constantly. And somehow, the group all still tolerate him, nay revere him?? He literally does bad spoiler thing in the Gongaga reactor and Tifa is like, you good Cloud no worries babe. AT LEAST Cloud has some decent sexual tension with Sephiroth, who spends 80% of his screen time just glaring. I'm kinda into that.</p>
    <p>That was a lot of words about the vibe of the game, here's my review of the gameplay: The battle system in the game is really good. It took me a while to get into it (I'd forgotten everything from the previous game) but it's satisfying and fun. I also enjoy the Queen's Blood card game a lot. It's cool that there aren't any loading screens.</p>

    <h2>Metal Gear Solid (PS1 - Collection on Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 7/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 3/10</p>
    <p>This isn't my first Kojima game but it's definitely the first one I've committed to and played through to the end, and I have to say, I don't vibe with his sense of humour! Making fun of otakus, action films and… women, it's all a bit much for me. This game is for fans of Die Hard or Terminator, and not people like me who like nice things.</p>
    <p>That being said I have to hand it to Metal Gear Solid for creating an action film game that actually works. The atmosphere and soundtrack is fantastic! Snake is ridiculous, but funny and kinda cool. He needs to stop hitting on every woman he sees though he genuinely sounds desperate. I also enjoy how over-the-top all the characters are, especially Liquid Snake, as well as the plot twists. They're genuinely hilarious.</p>
    <p>Gameplay-wise it isn't for me, stealthing around and then just murdering people isn't very fun, so I don't think I'll play any more of these games. But it was nice to see where Snake from Smash came from. I'm still on my journey to play, complete and understand every game that all the smash characters come from, so it's nice to tick off another character. Only a handful remain!</p>

    <h2>Cassette Beasts (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 2/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 7/10</p>
    <p>This is an indie game inspired by Pokemon where it's very much the same as Pokemon in many many ways but brings in some cool new gameplay features. In this game it's possible to fuse monsters together and they straight up made designs and names for every single combination (and there are over 100 of the things!). That alone is an incredible achievement and I was thoroughly enjoying seeing new combinations of my favourite mons even at the end of the game. However, there are so many of them that their specialness does kinda wear off after a while.</p>
    <p>It must have taken so long to do all the fusions… and I think the Dev time they spent on that should have been spent on… the rest of the game. It really is a technical mess! This game is glitchier than the newer Pokemon games which is impressive and the crazy loading screens and bad graphics is just on a different level. Normally I'm not too much of a bitch when it comes to this stuff, but it negatively affects the vibe of the game and is impossible to ignore. I can't recommend the game for that alone.</p>
    <p>One good thing was the open world aspect, you can go to any area whenever, which is great for catching cool mons. The worst thing about Pokemon (Well maybe not but for me a super annoying thing) is not being able to get a team of your faves early on in the game. All my faves are late game Pokemon and I'm pissed about that. The best thing about Pokemon is curating a team of my favourite mons and giving them all the love and attention that they deserve, watching them grow and beating the game with them. In cassette beasts I was able to find my faves (of course the dumbest designs ever, and this game has plenty of goofy ass mons that I'm immediately drawn to) and I was also able to swap them out easily because the levelling up is based on your character, not your mons, a great idea.</p>
    <p>To end this with another fat negative, the writing is terrible and generic. The premise is very forced, and even the interesting boss characters don't make much sense really. Also, I was not vibing at all with the soundtrack, some cheesy soft rock/indie songs with vocals. I was told it had a good OST but it wasn't good for my tastes and I ended up muting the game.</p>
    <p>Actually I'll end with a fat positive, the game features a delightful companion character who joins you towards the end, who single handedly brings a fantastic energy to the game, and when he comes with you at the end… just great.</p>

    <h2>Tongue Tale (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 3/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 6/10</p>
    <p>A friend of mine made this! So I was curious how it was going to be. Imagine being a solo dev on a hobby project and having it release on switch! Awesome. So shoutouts to Remke - you can buy the game and support him.</p>
    <p>The game itself is heavily inspired by Celeste - super difficult platforming designed to be super satisfying when you finally get it, and made more fun by restarting failed levels faster than you can blink. It's based on a pretty interesting mechanic of swinging on your tongue, where you use momentum and timing to propel yourself through hand-crafted levels. It's something that you can get better at and is really satisfying when you get right. Many of the puzzles are based on timing jumps and letting go of your tongue at the precise moment when you will fly at just the right angle, which requires a good spatial understanding.</p>
    <p>Shit's not easy, which in theory isn't a problem - Celeste is similar. However, where this game fails is finding that difficulty balance in the level design. Celeste somehow manages to find the sweetspot between “this is kinda easy” and “this is bullshit”, presumably through a hell of a lot of playtesting. Tongue Tale doesn't manage to do that (sorry Remke). The first world is a lot of fun, but somewhere in the second or third world the difficulty spikes so insanely quickly into the “this is bullshit” realm that it kinda detracts from the experience. I eventually did beat the game, but I have to admit it was a struggle.</p>

    <h2>Age of Mythology: Retold (PC)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 2/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 6/10</p>
    <p>Some friends convinced me to try this and we played it together in a LAN-format which was fun. I wasn't able to keep up with all the tactics though and didn't feel great about grinding the game to get good at it. Wasn't keen on the length of the games - would rather have either a quick run so I can easily jump in and out, or super long like Factorio or Civilisation.</p>

    <h2>1000xRESIST (Switch)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 3/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 5/10</p>
    <p>This is a visual novel about a future in which aliens destroyed everything, but one lady somehow survived and made lots of clones of herself. Those clones learn about how things came to be, it's an interesting premise!</p>
    <p>I got a bit of a bad start to the game because I just gave this visceral reaction to stories set in North America with American voice acting. At first glance it looks like more American TV, and I guessed it wouldn't have too much depth to it. On top of that, it was going for very abstract and indiscrete vibes, a little too arty farty for me.</p>
    <p>As I got into it I did see its merit, it's got some interesting things to say about why bad people act the way they do, and choices as a player in the scope of a video game. That being said, I wasn't motivated to go back for other endings after I got a bad ending.</p>
    <p>I think the emotional parts were a bit forced, and the music was kinda generic. I wouldn't recommend it.</p>

    <h2>A Little to the Left (Xbox Gamepass)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 4/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 2/10</p>
    <p>Tried out this little thing on Fab's Xbox. It's a game where you have to line things up neatly. I think it's great for people with OCD but I don't have that so I was left unsatisfied.</p>

    <h2>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix (PS4)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 5/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 2/10</p>
    <p>Having suffered through Kingdom Hearts 1, Chain of Memories and 358/2 Days last year, everyone was telling me to grit my teeth and play Kingdom Hearts 2 because it's “actually good” but lord these fans are blinded by nostalgia. This game is equally as bad as the first game, except it has more stuff in it!
    <p>However, I have to hand it to them for making this game real. Having such a ridiculously convoluted story, bewildering cameos from disney characters and final fantasy characters just hanging out. Incredible that it happened. I can imagine that at the time, this game would have been so fucking crazy.</p>
    <p>The game features so many cameos it's actually ridiculous. All the stories and worlds are short and shallow so they can fit in more content. I think the appeal is more like “wow I am riding Aladdin's magic carpet” rather than “this carpet minigame is fun”.</p>
    <p>One thing I appreciate about Kingdom Hearts is the stilted dialogue, which leads to the funniest cutscenes ever. I watched a “kingdom hearts” out of context video and it had me cackling. The comedic timing on some of the nonsense that the characters spout really does tickle me.</p>
    <p>I admit, I didn't engage with the battle system as much as I could have. I played on normal mode and mashed X to get through the game. Only at the very end of the game I realised you could increase your ability points by using items. In the final world I had a ridiculously difficult boss fight (Roxas) where the game suddenly turned into Elden Ring and I had to spend two hours increasing my level and learning his attack patterns. I was utterly unprepared and it didn't feel good to have to learn how to play the game then to beat him. In my defence, the player has to put in a lot of work to understand how stuff works. I'm used to modern games where things are properly explained.</p>
    <p>Well, I beat the game, which is saying something, I guess.</p>

    <h2>Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep (PS4)</h2>
    <p>Vibes: 5/10</p>
    <p>Gameplay: 2/10</p>
    <p>Using the last ounce of my fading strength, I launched into the next game in the collection, a prequel spinoff which follows three new characters. This game has even more battle systems than usual, and I was punished pretty quickly for not engaging with them. I managed to get quite far, but at some point it became clear that I would have to grind levels, and level up these commands, and worse, in order to do so, I would have to play a mario party-style minigame. I noped out of that, finally took a step to preserve my health and sanity, and put kingdom hearts down forever.</p>
