  <h1>Games I would like to play</h1>

  <p>
    Here is an up-to-date list of games that I really wanna play. Sadly I am way too busy to play all the games I want. So I will longingly put them here in this list, knowing full well that we live in a world with too many games and I will never get through them all.

  <div class="game-section">
    <h2>Switch Games</h2>
    <div class="game-list">
      <div *ngFor="let game of switchgames" class="game-title">
        {{ game }}
      </div>
    </div>
