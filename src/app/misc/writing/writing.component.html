  <h1>Some old things I wrote</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">I went down memory lane when I recently rediscovered my old Tumblr account! I went through all the old posts and have collected some of my favourites for this website. I must have been around 17 years old. I hope you enjoy!</p>
  <h2>My day in great detail</h2>
  <p>This morning dad woke me up, then I failed to get up so he came in again before he left for work, banged on the side of the wardrobe and wouldn’t stop till I stood up and touched my toes. Then he left, and I dozed for a bit longer. Then I went downstairs and had some delicious wholemeal oat crunchies, then lounged on the internet for a while. Then, I went upstairs and chugged through the third physics topic, Designer Materials. It’s all about how little things like dislocations affect the mechanical properties of various materials, mainly plastics, metals and ceramics. You should see my notes for physics they are fab. Just fab.</p>
  <p>After doing that I had some food. It was around 10 to noon. I ate a tesco value bean salad which was very below par. Too much vinegary dressing, not enough bean. No taste. Very disheartening. I ate in front of the tele like a bad person, and watched Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. That was good. I used to be able to recite the whole opening sequence! Then I sat at the computer and did some french listening. Then some french comprehension. Finished my little pack of exercises the teacher gave me. Then I realised that the bean salad was a really unsatisfying lunch so I made pasta. Afternoon pasta. That rocked. Dolmio.</p>
  <p>Then my brother Cam and his Australian friend who’s been staying with us for a few days invited me to come play badminton in the garden with them, yknow with an invisible net. It was fun! Nice to be in the sun, and not holed up doing work. I got embarrassingly sweaty, and tactfully used the feeding-the-cat excuse to make sure I didn’t die of exhaustion right there. I’m so unfit. I went in the house, made a cup of tea, then brought it round to the neighbours. I fed their cat. Then I took the back way back so the others wouldn’t see me and make me play more badminton. Anyway by that point they’d started throwing this little thing which whistled when it was thrown around.</p>
  <p>I sat down and started my statistics paper. It was hard. I’m worried about stats because I can’t remember anything. That particular exam is next friday. I’m sure it’ll be fine though. Thing I’m most worried about is that I have five relatively important exams next week all at once! I’ll have to just switch from maths to french to more maths to physics and then to music. I haven’t done any music. I still need to decide on my five landmark pop songs! I’ve only got two! But the Mozart essay should be fine. I rock at Mozart. Ohhhhh yeah. Mum came back from work and gave me a list of chores as usual. Half an hour later, after having done the bins and sorted out all the laundry and taken it up, and cleared the hall, and my room a bit, I sat down on question 5 of the stats paper. (stats is like 7 massive questions) then BAM straight away it was dinner. Groan because I’d just got comfortable.</p>
  <p>Dinner was fish and chips. That was nice. I ate all the peas and the broccoli first so I could get the worst out the way and actually enjoy the meal. It was okay. The fish was really slimy though. Felt wierd in my mouth. The chips were great though. I have this thing with chips. At the pub where I wash up, I just grab a plate at the beginning of the evening then pile on the spare chips! Whatever. Nicking some before they go out, or maybe if people havent eaten all theirs. THEN when the pans come back I would dip them in all the crazy sauces. Omigosh, heaven. Totally makes my job worth doing.</p>
  <p>Anyway, after dinner I loaded the dishwasher then went on the computer and logged on to tumblr.</p>
  <h2>If Pokemon were real</h2>
  <p>I would so have an Omanyte. He’d be just amazing. Like Ash’s pikachu. I’d bring him everywhere :) And he’d never evolve, even though Omastars are kinda cool. He’d know moves like Rollout and I’d surf on him somehow <3</p>
  <p>Then I’d have a Piloswine and it’d be awesome because I’d go to the French Alps on holiday like I have done a few times and accidentally go off-piste when I’m skiing and bump into a Swinub! Then I’d catch him and we’d be friends for life <3</p>
  <p>Then I’d have a Nosepass because they’re so amazing and hilarious. I’d win her in a competition! A rare but kinda weak pokemon from another country UNTIL I RAISE HER then she’d learn electric moves <3</p>
  <p>Then I’d have a Cubone because they’re delightful. SO CWOOT :3 And it’d be all sad and lonely when I find it and I’d be like AWWWW COME ERE :D Maybe he’ll evolve one day but that wouldn’t have happened yet <3</p>
  <p>Then I’d have a Cradily, who’d be the ultimate powerhouse of the team. Absolute BEAST. I’d find a Lileep when going rockpooling at the beach. Have I ever said I love rockpooling? <3</p>
  <p>Then I’d have a Forretress because I LOVE BUG TYPES! And I need one, and Forretress is just so amazing. He’d be the silent one, who it nice, but keeps to him self. But he’s reliable, yknow. He KNOWS when to explode! <3</p>
  <p>I WOULD ALSO HAVE QWILFISH. HE’D BE ABLE TO SUB IN IF ANY OF THE OTHERS DONT FEEL LIKE IT. HE’S MY TRUMP CARD.</p>
  <h2>Smoky Progg experience</h2>
  <p>I’ve been playing pikmin again recently and today I came across this THING which I’ve never seen before. In the Distant Spring, in the massive egg that I kinda just ignored all times before, this freaking scary thing had its creepy eyes on me. Then I THREW A BLUE PIKMIN ON THE EGG OUT OF CURIOSITY and it started hammering away at it then BAM! EVIL SMOKY THING COMES OUT, RUNS OVER MY LITTLE BLUE GUY THEN COMES AFTER ME. I was terrified. I ran back, gathered everyone up and hid them away in their onions, then took out 10 reds. I threw them onto it’s face but it shook them off, and then RAN THEM OVER. THEY DIED INSTANTLY. LIKE THE MOMENT THEY TOUCHED THAT BLACK STUFF COMING OUT THE BACK. I freaked and ran into another part of the spring. AND IT JUST FOLLOWED. I kept going threw the firey geysers into the tree stump area in the middle and it followed me all the way into the place where the cannon beetle was. DEAD END. I ignored the beetle because I mean, they were only rocks it was rolling at me, I was more worried about the DEATH INCARNATE heading towards me. When it got to the middle of the stump, I ran round it and out again, and quickly round the corner and BAM it got stuck in the tree stump! It kept trying to follow me out via a direct path but finding itself going straight into the side of the stump. I was like SCORE! I ran back to the onions and got out like 20 pikmin of every colour and went back to where death was rolling against the edge of the tree stump thinking ‘How am I gonna do this…’ WELL GUESS WHAT. Turns out the beetle had been shooting rocks at it or something because it was on half health! OH GOD YES. But I still didn’t know what to do. Last time I threw reds at it they just disintegrated right there and then. So I went for a different tactic! I got 5 yellows and went to find some bombs, and they picked them up for me. And get this, I threw an armed yellow OVER the edge of the tree stump and it hit the monster! The bomb exploded and did some good damage! It only had a quarter of it’s health left! So I excitedly threw the other four in but I took too long on the fourth one and the bombs all exploded in a chain too early and about 15 pikmin died! Only one of the blasts actually hit the freak thing. so it was down to low health, then my favourite beetle shot a rock at it and BAM! DEAD. I breathed a sigh of relief then slumped back in my chair. Turns out the little heart thing it left behind helped me germinate a whopping 100 little flower creatures.</p>
