                        "Recently, Jack and Anni were at my place and I was playing music from Mario Kart World. Conversation drifted to one of Anni's favourite childhood games, New Super Mario Bros for the DS, and I offered them to play a game from the series together. I ended up booting up New Super Mario Bros. U for the Wii U, because I never got the port on the switch, which involved setting up the Wii U in front of my friends. I was suddenly transported back to Nintendo's flop era, around 2013, when this was the only game around the Wii U's launch.",
                        "Having to explain what the gamepad was, and that you need to use the gamepad to navigate the main menu, was almost embarrassing! I respect the gamepad - it walked so the switch could run - but it's so big and clunky, and I had to find the specific charger that it required (USB-C wasn't ubiquitous back then), just so I could start the game. Of course I also had to find batteries for the Wii Remotes I still had lying around, which was honestly quite enjoyable, although these controllers were janky and not working properly after all those years.",
                        "Then we went into the game itself, the original New Super Mario Bros. U, which bearing in mind is the fourth entry in a series of near-identical games. It was very much considered a safe Mario game that will sell well no matter what, so they barely changed it since the original DS title. And those game design decisions were plain to see. In this game, you can only save after beating a boss in a castle. If you die, you get kicked out of the level and have to re-enter, which takes almost a whole minute. There is pretty nifty multiplayer mechanic where if you die, you lose a life, but return as a bubble, so you can immediately keep playing. That's great, but you can also just bubble yourself with the press of the button, which means you can just coast through the levels, as long as the others keep playing. Also, Jack lost all their lives and simply had to watch Anni and me play without them! These things are all pretty inconceivable today.",
                        "Vibes-wise, I actually like the Wii U, and I think the soundtracks of even generic games like New Super Mario Bros. U are pretty solid. However, it's unforgivable that you can't play as Peach. Back then Nintendo didn't believe in women. The hardest part about that era though was just the absolute dearth of games! Nowadays we are spoiled by a rich and successful Nintendo releasing 1st party games every month. Back then we waited half a year for Pikmin 3 or Splatoon or Yoshi's Woolly World or something. It was slim pickings. Only until 2017's Breath of the Wild did it all start coming together for Nintendo and for us, the die-hard Nintendo fans.",
                        "Otherwise my life has been a constant stream of activity, and I'm starved for days off. I've always been like this and I don't see it changing anytime soon. At some point my body will say no and make me ill, but until then I'm saying yes to all plans because FOMO is too strong. And in website news, I've made two more playlists for your (and my own) enjoyment. First is very sad music for when you feel miserable and you want to lean into the bad feelings, and the second is for when the wind is coursing through your hair while you are cycling down a hill or something."
