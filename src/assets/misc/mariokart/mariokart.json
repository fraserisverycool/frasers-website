Unlike the rest of the game, they are all flat and don't lend themselves to fun shortcuts, but rather just good driving. I like it! And I love that they finally remixed this song!! And leaned into its latin flavour. Love the music that plays as you approach this stage. Great.",

The B section of this music introduces us to the classic Rainbow Road music that we know and love and I am just so thankful. I think the idea to make a rainbow racetrack in space was inspired. The track itself is plain, but has no walls! So you need to have learned how to use the drift button properly by this point.",

I loved when they featured that little section at the end in the Rainbow Road smash medley - that is a deep cut! The sad part is that when playing this game though, you'll probably finish the race before the song gets to that part. Otherwise this track is hard is nails because there are jumps instead of edges, but it allows for some wild shortcuts.",

      "description": "Putting Rainbow Road on a space station is inspired, and I approve the mixup! However at the end of the day, this stage isn't serving that Rainbow Road vibe that I crave. It starts off with a tight figure of 8, which is cool, then you land on a space station, which is cool, then the path splits in two, which is cool. Yet somehow the vibes are off.",

It's got a fancy part and a dirty run-down part, which is funny because it hints at the existence of wealth inequality in the world of Mario Kart. The 3-lap version is super fun with loads of different sections which makes it super fun, and at the end it's over the rooves which is so fun.",
