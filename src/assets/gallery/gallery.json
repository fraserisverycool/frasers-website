We paid a couple of pesos and had 5 minutes in Smash Melee, which was just about enough to destroy Jack with melee Peach, even though I was unable to do any float cancels with the joystick",

We asked a ton of questions and showed a ton of interest, so much so that at the end he let us see his office, pictured here. He had all these shelves of pieces that needed to be registered and getting that insider look was just so fucking cool",

Not only was the day beautiful, the hike beautiful and the beach beautiful, but we also had an amazing moment at this beach. It started to rain, so everyone got into one of the lancha boats you can see in the picture. Everyone struggled, fell inside unceremoniously, or needed to be helped by the driver. We were the last to enter, and although I was nervous, I just went for it and hoisted myself in. By some miracle, I did a perfect flip and landed on the seat so smoothly that people behind me were audibly impressed. Then the cute boy featured in the picture comes up, passes me his shoes and bag then does an equally impressive twist into the boat right next me, then gives me a little kiss. Everyone on the boat cheered!",

I had forgotten just how ugly that pokemon is, and if you know we well, you'll know that I love ugly pokemon the most. Then in the game, it evolved into Lickilicky and I was absolutely blown away by how ugly it is. I became obsessed - why does it have Wifi on its belly? Why is its tongue like that? I even painted a picture of Lickilicky for my house where it says, 'I choose you, Lickilicky!'. So when I saw this keychain right next to Pikachu and Charmander, I almost had a heart attack. Lickilicky was just there. Anyway I bought it and now it's my official DJ USB decoration, here pictured with Filthy Dog",
