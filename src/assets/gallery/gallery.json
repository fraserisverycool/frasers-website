We paid a couple of pesos and had 5 minutes in Smash Melee, which was just about enough to destroy Jack with melee Peach, even though I was unable to do any float cancels with the joystick",

We asked a ton of questions and showed a ton of interest, so much so that at the end he let us see his office, pictured here. He had all these shelves of pieces that needed to be registered and getting that insider look was just so fucking cool",

It started to rain, so everyone got into one of the lancha boats you can see in the picture. Everyone struggled, fell inside unceremoniously, or needed to be helped by the driver. We were the last to enter, and although I was nervous, I just went for it and hoisted myself in. By some miracle, I did a perfect flip and landed on the seat so smoothly that people behind me were audibly impressed. Then Arturo comes up, passes me his shoes and bag then does an equally impressive twist into the boat right next me, then gives me a little kiss. Everyone on the boat cheered!",

I wore the Trousers in combination with this matching-colour jacket I found at Humana and although I knew it was a pretty out-there outfit, I felt right at home at the party. I even won a prize! Here I am pictured with Sam who I love and adore",
