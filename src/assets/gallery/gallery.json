      "description": "As a thank you for hosting 10 BREXIT SUMMITs, the smash community got me this Boris cut-out and it is a funny present, given I was really giving speeches about politics before each of these tournaments. I understand how people associated me (with my tag BREXIT) to him during this time when he was PM, but god it means I have this thing that I can't really throw away just in my house. He is currently hidden somewhere so I don't have to look at him. In this picture he is sitting on my beautiful orange sofa which was with me for a long time. I drove this thing across the country and I loved it so much",
