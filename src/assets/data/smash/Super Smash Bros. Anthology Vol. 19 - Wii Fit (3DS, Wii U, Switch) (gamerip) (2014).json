    "description": "Great remix! Wii Fit always had an excellent soundtrack in terms of vibes and this remix really takes it to the next level. I feel like it's very cheeky and camp. I remember being so excited about this remix when it played during Wii Fit's little introduction video for ultimate.",

It just keeps going and getting better and I just can't get enough. Funnily enough, it doesn't sound like this in game, the smash team sped it up and I love that they did that.",
