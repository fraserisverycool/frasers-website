        "So delightful to play another Sakurai game! The smash vibes are very strong in this game. The soundtrack is pretty good, with an absolute banger of a menu theme, and the levels you race on are crazy cool. You can play as Rick the hamster, which is amazing, but I'm a little broken-hearted that you can't play as Kine the fish.",
        "Controlling is kinda hard! This isn't baby mode like Mario Kart World (which I loved), you have to get a feel for it. Having both sucking in enemies and drifting being the same button is kinda confusing though. Also, there's an attack you can do if you wiggle the stick, which confuses me quite a lot. I really connected with the Road Trip mode, which in effect taught me the game. Thanks to that I tried out all the machines and got a hang of the drifting. I think my favourite is the Rocket one where you have to charge to the max each time. It's extreme but satisfying!"

        "A cool vibe from a hellish gambling game where it's not actually about gambling, it's about optimising and finding bottlenecks and scaling numbers. It's actually just Balatro. It's Balatro all over again with a slot machine instead of poker hands. Fab and I got a really good run on our first run because we got some great synergies with diamonds. I'm interested to keep playing to know if it's possible to leave the room but something tells me it's not. Cool game, just would have been better if it were released BEFORE Balatro..."

Turns out, this game might be the first ever survival-type game. Probably the reason why games like 'Don't Starve' exist. So for science I booted it up and gave it a good try.",
        "First, I was pleasantly surprised by the banger music. Always a great sign when the OST ist good. I was looking for materials while grooving to the max. It's almost as if the child that I'm playing as hasn't been stranded alone on an island! Considering it's a game about not dying, it's surprisingly peppy and fun. The intro story was funny, it said the child and their dad were the only crew on the boat when it was shipwrecked, and then it shows just a massive cruise ship sinking. No wonder it sank - there were only two people on board!",
        "I didn't make it far in the game, regrettably. It hit me that there's a reason that I didn't enjoy 'Don't Starve'. At any moment, my hunger or thirst could drop to zero and then bam, I have to start the whole game again! That is so stressful. And the game really doesn't do any signposting at all. I don't think it's possible to actually complete it without some kind of guide."

They are baffling, expansive and vibe-heavy games in which you play as a dolphin! Truly a first in the dolphin genre. I also heard that they are hard as balls so I was curious, and indeed, it's hard as balls. It's totally confounding and has no information about where to go or what to do. You just swim around and die to random things all the time. Definitely the kind of game to just listen to the soundtrack to and not actually play."

        "Ever since falling in love with Streets of Rage 4, I've been meaning to get into this game as well, and I'm so glad I did! The reason to open up this game on the Nintendo Switch Online is so you can listen to one of the best soundtracks of all time. It's inspired by house and techno music and each track is a fucking banger. I have literally DJ'd some of these tracks before (Go Straight and Dreamer) they are that good. They hold up today!",
        "The opening music is the biggest vibe ever, although booting up the game I realised you can't actually listen to the whole opening track before the opening ends. Devastating. But it's fine because it gets straight into 'Go Straight', the most incredible first level music ever. Perfect music to beat up goons to. It's a bombastic house anthem that turns into the jazziest remix of itself when you enter the bar halfway through the level. Then in later levels you have 'Slow Moon', 'Dreamer'... just banger after banger.",
        "The game itself is doable! I got to stage 7 or so using my fundamentals from Streets of Rage 4 which felt great. I quickly realised Blaze's flip move does crazy damage. But the difficulty curve is tough, it doesn't fuck around. I think it's fine because back then these arcade-style games needed to have that replayability, and this really does. You play over and over until you know all the levels back to front, and can beat them with all the characters. Part of me wishes I was into this game as a child.",
        "It also has a really lovely co-op mode! Victor and I played together for a bit and it was awesome. Super fun to play with a second person."

        "I can't believe that after 7 years we actually got this game, and that it's as good as it is. Shoutouts to the dev team for ignoring the internet's feverish cries and instead taking their sweet time crafting the best metroidvania ever. They let this cook for as long as they needed - I mean they had all that money from the first game so why not! And the result is, they made a huge and beautiful game. And they sold it for just 20€! Incredible stuff. Defy the markets and do the right thing! I guess it's something you can only do as an indie studio if you make a legendary game like the first Hollow Knight.",
        "Playing this has been a total pleasure because at the same time I've watched Victor play the first Hollow Knight. Watching him get immersed into the familiar world of Hollow Knight while I simultaneously jump into the brand new world of Silksong has been amazing because we can compare experiences. This game has so many moments of wonder as you discover a brand new area, desperately looking for a bench or a map.",
        "In the game, you need to climb up what appears to be a mountain, which has a Citadel at the top. You already know there's gonna be a City of Tears-style ruined civilisation in that citadel and this game serves exactly that and SO MUCH MORE! And of course there is an equally rich and dense lore behind all these bugs and insects, just like in the first one. And you get to play as the cute and beautiful Hornet! She feels kinda different and I like it. I also love that she actually speaks! And not only that, but is well spoken. I'm done with silent protagonists. Bring me more protagonists like Hornet, who eloquently talk about smart stuff with NPCs. Yes.",
        "Just like the original game, this game nails the vibe. There is a deep sadness in all of the caves. An almost dead civilisation dragging themselves towards some kind of inevitable doom. Some of the bugs have lost it already, some are nice but struggling. Some are making things work for them in the hellscape. The music reflects all that! The Bone Bottom music, the place where there is the least hope, is so desperately sad. Then you have the incredible Choral Chambers - wow! I haven't sat down to ask myself what kind of chord sequence that is yet but I am entranced. I also adore the music from Greyhome, and weirdly also the strangely beautiful Bilewater - somewhat unfitting music for such a horrible place.",
        "This game will stay with me for a long time. It's an absolute gem! Some of the bosses are really hard but even though that Last Judge one really got me going, none of them have really been UNFAIR unfair. At least not yet. I haven't completed it 100% at the time of writing... EDIT That bitch in the void took me days and was totally unfair!!"

I really didn't like the corporate vibe of the game. The music sounds like generic 'middle eastern' music for an epic blockbuster film. I also feel like the animations are a bit off. The artstyle is good though! They had a vision, that's for sure. But something about playing this while playing Silksong makes it feel so clunky and shit in comparison. I'm looking forward to playing Hades 2 later this year though!"

I read somewhere people call them 'Metroidbrainias' which I thoroughly enjoy. Although this game is actually a roguelike! You go through a explore this mansion by drafting new rooms as you go. Each room is full of secrets about what's actually going on and it makes you want to learn everything about the game.",
        "At the time of writing this I found the 46th room and decided to call it a day because the scope of the game is terrifying. I had many amazing eureka moments throughout my playthrough but one of them was learning about a crazy chess puzzle, thanks to happening to have the device you need to light candles on me when I finally got the basement key and was able to go down the fountain to the special area at the back. When I saw that those notes I had made about chess pieces in different rooms were about to be used... wait I have to draft them ALL? On top of this, my mate Rodrigo revealed at this point that he had over 150 hours in the game. For my sanity and my safety, I have to say no to the chess puzzle. I'll probably just get another sanctum key anyway, and that puzzle where I have to learn about all the history in order to make those sigils, my GOD. I wrote like 20 pages of notes for this, and I would have needed a new book to solve that one.",

When I figured out that you can jump forwards on a rock, stop doing that and bounce of the rock, and then roll forwards and punch in the air to go a bit further, I started to do that to get to all sorts of faraway places.

        "Incredible! They just went and made the best Mario Kart ever. Mario Kart 8 really perfected the formula so I was asking myself how they would top it. By making it open world and having you drive between tracks, it has completely changed the formula and breathed new life into the series. At first I was skeptical about only going around the tracks for one lap and spending two or more laps travelling to the next one, but actually that's what this game is all about: all the crazy shit they throw at you between the tracks. No longer can you get good at Mario Kart by just learning all the tracks because you'll never learn this entire world. Instead, you have to react to all the new twists and turns awaiting you in every race. It means this will be replayable for ages!",
        "I really love the VS mode where you can select literally any stage and go from anywhere to anywhere. There are infinite possibilities! The other mode, Knockout tour, is also great, especially when playing online. However how come I can't make my own knockout tours out of my favourite tracks? That would be my one main wish for the game. Then I love the open world free roam mode! You can just explore all these cool places and it's absolutely covered in references to old Mario Kart games, which I love to soak up.",
        "But the real crown jewel of this game is the SOUNDTRACK! Holy shit!!! Not only does this feature absolute banger music for the 30 or so official tracks they have (including awesome intro music as you approach the stage), but it also features of 200 tracks of remixes of old mario and mario kart songs!! Between tracks and especially in the free roam and even on the main menu, you can just hear all this music. It's amazing! We've got reimaginings and modernisations of old and forgotten tracks, favourites, and just well everything in between. The sheer volume is insane, and each one has been made with such love. Playing this game and just hearing something like the Mario Kart DS credits theme, or Bowser's Castle GBA, or many obscure tracks just sets me off. Playing this game with me is insufferable because I will stop the conversation to point out the name of the track and how much I love it.",
        "Also, the characters! I love playing as Cheep Cheep, Snowman, Piranha Plant... I mean what an honour. I love it. I think this is gonna be a huge game on this system and I can't wait to keep playing it over the next decade!"

I was a little disappointed to learn that this was a roguelike. These days roguelikes make me upset because I would get a really good run then feel like I could never reach those heights again. This game offers next to nothing in terms of 'roguelite' elements, i.e. things that will make future runs easier. Instead you just have to git gud. I kinda have gotten better, but the element of luck involved is kinda putting me off. I'm sticking with it because I want to know about the lore and what some of these secrets mean."

It's definitely not the kind of game I would willingly buy, although I do have an appreciation for the Wii-era Nintendo Mii vibe, and I did play Tomodachi Life back then on the DS.",
        "This game is totally fucked up and I cannot recommend it in good conscious. It's a turn based RPG, although there is little to no strategy, and all the characters fight on their own, not really requiring your input. Playing this game you quickly realise it's not about gameplay, it's about the relationships between all the Miis you create. They all have little personalities and are very sassy with one another, early animal crossing style. I have it say, it's funny as fuck. I can really imagine this being hilarious if you take mushrooms. The sheer amount of nonsense is just insane.",
        "I spent a ridiculous amount of time at the start of the game making a bunch of high quality Miis, and realised that there are so many NPCs in the game, and you can make Miis for them all. I just felt invested because these Miis were all so good, I couldn't just drop the game, even if there isn't really a game here. So I would progress, and every now and then, another one of my horrible creations would turn up and it would just be hilarious.",

Luckily, the horse that you befriend some ways into the game broke up the fight.",

This is great most of the time, but this game does have power ups which make certain puzzles possible, and sometimes when I'm tackling a tough puzzle I doubt myself whether I'm just too dumb to solve it, or if I actually need to collect a power-up from somewhere else first. It's led to a couple of moments of frustration, but it's totally forgivable given how good the puzzles are.",

Part of me would like to go back and 100% but I do feel like the game might be too insanely hard, especially with some of the later areas."

So when I saw this sequel I was sceptical because it's just a plain old rhythm game. Nonetheless I like me a rhythm game and it's a been a while so I got it and it's so good. This might be the most polished rhythm game I've ever played.",
        "It's hard as nails, but also so reasonable! The timings are forgiving, and there's this system where you lose health if you get hit by an incoming monster, so if you don't press the right button in time. But if you press the wrong button at any given point, you don't lose health, instead you lose your combo. So it means that you can kind of mash on the difficult bits, and at first this bothered me, but it just means that you can get through the levels without dying, just with a low score. So you can kinda play the game how you want, going for the high score or not. Going for the high score is insanely difficult but those leaderboards are tempting me, that's for sure.",
        "When I accidentally started a song on hard mode near the start, I was so shook. You're meant to be able to follow all that?? But by the end of playing through the story, I got so good at the game. Things which seemed impossible like those jumping harpies, I've totally got down now. I just needed to practice them and the songs they come in. I've since gone through and beaten (almost) everything on hard mode and it feels great. It feels so good to get good at the game, and this game lets you do that. The progression through the track is pretty great for that.",
        "There are some other things like minigames and bosses, but they're nothing compared to the actual core gameplay, it's all about the normal rhythm game stuff. I will say there is a really cool thing in 'remix mode' which randomises the monsters, so you kinda have serious replayability. And the difficulty levels will keep you going for a long time.",
        "I will admit, in terms of vibes, there is another rhythm game which has this beat: Everhood. Everhood had an actually fascinating story, lots of funny and wacky nonsense and all around great vibes. This game is far more generic in terms of presentation, and the story is actually a joke. I would have loved some funny writing. But at least the music is good! I didn't love the heavy metal tracks because I'm just not a fan of the genre, but also because they tended to be too fast, making reactions really hard. But most of the tracks were delightful. Personal favourites were from 'Sam Webster' and 'Nick Nausbaum'."

I don't think achieves it though. Firstly because the game has a 3D camera, a double jump and a air-dash, and multitasking - it's hard for people who don't know how to play games. Secondly because the vibes are off. Let's talk about the vibes.",

Actually there are tons of great ideas in general, especially in terms of gameplay mechanics. But the two characters are so insufferable it hurts. One of them is happy-go-lucky and the other is sarcastic and rude. And as I learned playing the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, it drives me insane to see characters who have no social skills. This bitch Mio is so rude it blew me away. You are literally trapped in a fantasy land with a stranger and you don't take a moment to appreciate your never-seen-before surroundings or the fact that magic exists and just talk about it! If I were Zoe I would be pissed.",

She is totally alone on an alien planet and has to deal with a bunch of bullshit and take down this insane monster by herself, and she does it because she's fucking Samus.

It's not trying to make any points about war or even tell a good story, it's just trying to be a banger strategy game, which it is. The soundtrack is a bop too - all the old themes I loved from back then, remade and with special individual tracks for when you activate your CO power (a much needed change)."

You have 13 whole-ass protagonists who all have intricately interconnected lives and stories, and you get to follow all their journeys in any order you like. Octopath Traveler, eat your heart out! Unlike that stiff storytelling with 8 entirely separate stories, hear all the characters interact and it is so exciting. I admit that it relies on some of those classic anime tropes a lot, but I allow it because the actual story is so wild and unpredictable. It's got all these great plot twists and because you decide what order to learn about them, discovering them makes it feel like YOU figured it out, or that you stumbled onto some juicy information that you shouldn't have found already. Delicious.",

Focus of this game is on the incredible and absolutely wild story though. Highly recommended."

        "Holy crap, is this game real? Dear visitors to this website, please consider dropping everything and buying this collection of 50 arcade games for the low price of 20 euros. You have to understand, this isn't just any old collection of NES/arcade-style games, these are all brand-new games! They've been developed with modern game design philosophy and ALL of the games are bangers. All 50 of them!",
        "This collection has everything: platformers, puzzle games, action games, top down strategy, RPGs, and plenty of wacky, hard-to-define-genre games as well. Each of them bring something new to the table, to the point where most of them could be expanded into their own indie games and they would be fucking great. Inevitably, not every game will be for everyone, but that's the beauty of UFO 50 - everyone can find something that suits their tastes in there, and everyone will also end up trying out different kinds of games that they would otherwise never touch.",
        "Personally I love puzzle games so I was delighted when the very first game I picked happened to be a block puzzle game called Block Koala. I got so into block koala and although I recognise why most people wouldn't rate the game very high, I totally clicked with it and very quickly 100%ed it. Camouflage was another banger puzzle game, so good.",
        "Other highlights for those who are interested were definitely Rail Heist, Vainger, Mortol 2, Night Manor, Party House and Hyper Contender. Block Koala still #1 though, maybe it's because it was the first one I picked. Feels like Block Koala and I have a special bond.",
        "One last thing I wanted to point out: this game has a huge and incredible chiptune soundtrack! Many of the tracks are even microtonal, which is something you hear almost never in video games. Hugely inspired and hugely inspiring. I couldn't pick a single recommendation so enjoy the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O-5JriuYm8s?feature=shared\">banger start-up music<a>."

The team did deliver on another high-standard zelda game, but I can't say I enjoyed playing through it as much as other zelda games. It's hard to say why, because the vibe is very much the same as Link's Awakening. I guess this vibe is closer to the beaten track. There's much less weird shit.",

Everytime I found a new monster I got excited about its echo, but always went back to my beloved, deku baba. I would describe my playstyle as Deku baba only. It's just so fast!",

Link is already a silent protagonist and then they put the two of them together in the end and they literally couldn't have a conversation. It's gone too far! It also felt like I might as well have been playing as Link the whole time. Only when your name is cleared and you can start going round in your pink dress did I feel a swell of pride about playing as a princess."

This game has even more battle systems than usual, and I was punished pretty quickly for not engaging with them. I managed to get quite far, but at some point it became clear that I would have to grind levels, and level up these commands, and worse, in order to do so, I would have to play a mario party-style minigame. I noped out of that, finally took a step to preserve my health and sanity, and put kingdom hearts down forever."

This game is equally as bad as the first game, except it has more stuff in it!\n",

I can imagine that at the time, this game would have been so fucking crazy.",

        "One thing I appreciate about Kingdom Hearts is the stilted dialogue, which leads to the funniest cutscenes ever. I watched a \"kingdom hearts out of context\" video and it had me cackling. The comedic timing on some of the nonsense that the characters spout really does tickle me.",

Only at the very end of the game I realised you could increase your ability points by using items. In the final world I had a ridiculously difficult boss fight (Roxas) where the game suddenly turned into Elden Ring and I had to spend two hours increasing my level and learning his attack patterns. I was utterly unprepared and it didn't feel good to have to learn how to play the game then to beat him. In my defence, the player has to put in a lot of work to understand how stuff works. I'm used to modern games where things are properly explained.",

The main thing to note about it is the stop motion/clay animation style. It gives it a vibe of being somewhat of a parody, like Team America or something. It means even the serious parts you have to enjoy with a smile. This combined with some honestly excellent dialogue makes for a delightful little experience.",
        "You play as a very plain and boring person who has a heart of gold, and he is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades handyman on a spaceship that is stuck in the sea of an alien world. All his colleagues speak down at him but in a loving way, and it's fun to see him deal with that. It's presented in a way that he might be depressed, but then he does find pleasure in the little interactions, because there are many delightful little quirks in the story to enjoy. After some twists in the story, you can see how his outlook changes, and it's handled quite maturely.",
        "It's got a nice little soundtrack, a lovely setting, and great characters. I really recommend it, although not if you're looking for a game. This is a visual novel through and through, you will only be pressing A!"

It's based on a pretty interesting mechanic of swinging on your tongue, where you use momentum and timing to propel yourself through hand-crafted levels. It's something that you can get better at and is really satisfying when you get right. Many of the puzzles are based on timing jumps and letting go of your tongue at the precise moment when you will fly at just the right angle, which requires a good spatial understanding.",

Celeste somehow manages to find the sweetspot between \"this is kinda easy\" and \"this is bullshit\", presumably through a hell of a lot of playtesting. Tongue Tale doesn't manage to do that (sorry Remke). The first world is a lot of fun, but somewhere in the second or third world the difficulty spikes so insanely quickly into the \"this is bullshit\" realm that it kinda detracts from the experience.

The first and most important thing to talk about is the insane glow-up that the soundtrack got. It has truly gotten the Origami King treatment and I mean that in the best possible way. They've added new tracks, new variations of existing tracks, and boldly updated the old favourites which is almost always tasteful and successful. The battle theme has multiple variations depending on the region you're in and it's touches like that which turn a good game into a special game. You're in a mysterious off-colour forest and run into an enemy? Consider the vibe MATCHED.",

        "This is an indie game inspired by Pokemon where it's very much the same as Pokemon in many many ways but brings in some cool new gameplay features. In this game it's possible to fuse monsters together and they straight up made designs and names for every single combination (and there are over 100 of the things!). That alone is an incredible achievement and I was thoroughly enjoying seeing new combinations of my favourite mons even at the end of the game. However, there are so many of them that their specialness does kinda wear off after a while.",
        "It must have taken so long to do all the fusions... and I think the Dev time they spent on that should have been spent on... the rest of the game. It really is a technical mess! This game is glitchier than the newer Pokemon games which is impressive and the crazy loading screens and bad graphics is just on a different level. Normally I'm not too much of a bitch when it comes to this stuff, but it negatively affects the vibe of the game and is impossible to ignore. I can't recommend the game for that alone.",
        "One good thing was the open world aspect, you can go to any area whenever, which is great for catching cool mons. The worst thing about Pokemon (Well maybe not but for me a super annoying thing) is not being able to get a team of your faves early on in the game. All my faves are late game Pokemon and I'm pissed about that. The best thing about Pokemon is curating a team of my favourite mons and giving them all the love and attention that they deserve, watching them grow and beating the game with them. In cassette beasts I was able to find my faves (of course the dumbest designs ever, and this game has plenty of goofy ass mons that I'm immediately drawn to) and I was also able to swap them out easily because the levelling up is based on your character, not your mons, a great idea.",
        "To end this with another fat negative, the writing is terrible and generic. The premise is very forced, and even the interesting boss characters don't make much sense really. Also, I was not vibing at all with the soundtrack, some cheesy soft rock/indie songs with vocals. I was told it had a good OST but it wasn't good for my tastes and I ended up muting the game.",

I love that you play as a tiny blob which can neatly fit through every gap. It's very polished and I respect that (just before this I played Cassette Beasts which is a bit of a technical mess so the contrast was there).",
        "This game has little to no background music which shocked me at first, because I am a lover of video game music. But it didn't take long for me to understand that that is crucial to the vibe of the environment. The sound design is super good even without the music - there is so much going on in terms of water dripping sounds, ambient noises, squelchy sounds as you move, it makes it all sound so real. And without the music it does give it that lonely metroid vibe. And on the occasions where music does play, it hits hard because of it. Interesting choice and although I'm a little upset because I'm sure a game with this vibe and colour scheme would have a beautiful twinkly soundtrack, I understand that not having music goes a long way to set this game apart from all the other super similar metroidvanias.",
        "This game is super similar to other metroidvanias, like it gave me heavy Axiom Verge vibes, which isn't a bad thing. It's got some very creative power-ups which are delightful, and focuses more on puzzle solving than combat, which I personally really appreciate. But there's another game which this clearly takes lots of inspiration from: Fez. Fez is this puzzler (also with a strong vibe) which you play through once, then it slowly dawns on you, that was just the beginning, and you are assaulted with many higher-level meta puzzles which turn the whole game on its head. Tunic was kinda similar too. Animal Well has the same thing going for it - you beat the game, and realise huh, there's more to it than this... you start digging and keep digging, and by the time you've reached some of the \"deeper\" parts of the well, you've already made a whole bunch of notes and are starting to go a bit crazy. I love that shit."

        "I've got a lot to say about this one so buckle up. As an enjoyer of the original FF7 and... I think I was an enjoyer of the previous game (Final Fantasy VII Remake), I felt the desire to play this game too. But I've been shocked by how horrifically sanitised it is. I think Remake was much the same but here it's even more so! I realised pretty quickly during this game that I'm not actually playing a game, I'm playing a product. I'm being served content and I'm supposed to enjoy it. After all this is a triple AAA big budget game that I paid full price for, and consumers like me have certain expectations. So the game gives me open world, generous dollops of fan-service, a whole ass card game, one thousand million mini games, a whole bunch of playable characters (including big seph), orchestral remixes of beloved old songs...",
        "It just all feels so forced! You can't escape it. Sure, this game has magic and love but it all stems from the very strong base of the original game. The world of FF7 is so fucking cool, with the world being overtaken by an energy company after they monopolise a new environment-destroying energy source. It's so topical, I love it. Seriously, play the original, it still holds up today and tells such a cool story about this fascinating world (a whole-ass planet, by the way). Rebirth isn't bad as such because it's built on this base. But what it adds is either annoying, superfluous or made without love.",
        "The worst offender is the open world. Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind an open world. But this one is less of an open world and more of a to-do list of pointless tasks in a big area. I have to go to the various spots and complete menial tasks in order to get a rush of dopamine as it is ticked off. Most aggravating for me was Chadley, the AI robot child character who sends Cloud off to do these super scripted ~I'm playing a video game~ tasks. Go defeat these monsters, go take a photo here, go activate this tower. What do I actually get out of this? Luckily I'm not actually invested enough in the gameplay to be interested in the materia you get from Chadley.",
        "One thing the open world does do is give the sense that you're exploring the whole planet. And I have to say it looks quite nice. The various towns all look fantastic as well. This is really a feast for the eyes, especially for those who played the original. Seeing Costa del Sol, Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon all looking so good is a treat. There are also lush, orchestral versions of the original soundtrack in these places, which is delightful.",
        "But while I'm talking about the soundtrack, I have to say that it's all over the place. The general vibe appears to be orchestral, but then it throws in the wacky stuff (certain sidequests, chocobo music, moogles, cactuars...) and the music goes all electronic and wild. There is also gratuitous jazz music here and there, and other random shit depending on what's going on. It feels like they're just cramming in as much content as possible. This is a recurring theme.",
        "Similar topic, this game switches from serious to silly so casually, it's jarring. The chocobos really are completely ridiculous! And there's something about seeing them in HD which makes it even wilder. In the OG, things happen so quickly and switch themselves up so regularly and you don't even bat an eyelid if you need to ride a chicken through the swamp. The vibe is so strong that silly things can coexist with the serious main story. In this remake, the silly, cartoonish things simply look so out of place, I can't take anything seriously.",
        "Two of the main characters (Red 13 and Cait Sith, my fave from the OG) are so outlandish in this game that it takes away any hopes of seriousness when they're involved. Actually despite that, I'm super happy with how they did Cait Sith because that really isn't easy to translate from the PS1 version and he looks and sounds great. Red 13 though, god the thing with his voice in Cosmo Canyon is so dumb, and he doesn't have any personality apart from that. He was way cooler in the OG I can't even describe. As for the other characters, Aerith and Barret are fine, they're both delightful. Tifa I can't even say anything because any semblance of a personality is completely eclipsed by her humongous knockers. Those badockadonks have their own field of gravity they are that huge. Whenever she's on screen I can't help but make an out-loud comment about how needlessly massive her tits are. Yuffie is beautifully animated, but her outfit from the original really needed an update. She's really a ninja, and trying to make a sleeveless, crop-top, turtlenecked, knitted woollen jumper work.",
        "The worst offender though is Cloud. God I hate how useless he is in social situations. They made him stand-offish and distant so that he looks like a badass, but to me he's just a dickhead. Aerith is trying so hard to make conversation and she is just suffering because Cloud just leaves her on read constantly. And somehow, the group all still tolerate him, nay revere him?? He literally does bad spoiler thing in the Gongaga reactor and Tifa is like, you good Cloud no worries babe. AT LEAST Cloud has some decent sexual tension with Sephiroth, who spends 80% of his screen time just glaring. I'm kinda into that.",
        "That was a lot of words about the vibe of the game, here's my review of the gameplay: The battle system in the game is really good. It took me a while to get into it (I'd forgotten everything from the previous game) but it's satisfying and fun. I also enjoy the Queen's Blood card game a lot. It's cool that there aren't any loading screens."

        "I was drawn to this game because of its colour scheme of all things. Everything is saturated in blue which gives it a very special vibe. It's the colours you see first thing when you wake up in the morning when you're still woozy and coming to. It reminds me of this game I played as a child \"Zool 2\" in terms of vibe. Something very special!",
        "I do feel like the character of Penny is a bit random. Her design is just a bunch of elements thrown together and doesn't have so much of a personality. There is some missed potential there, especially with the \"big breakaway\" part of the game. It doesn't feel like you're running away, but rather like you're going through some levels. If it were me, I would have gone for Penny running away constantly, with animations reflecting her fear/excitement, kinda like in Pizza Tower.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun, it's a momentum game kinda like Sonic, which makes sense because it's from the same devs as Sonic Mania (one of the best games ever). And by the end of the game I kinda got it with the loop, dash and jump moves. At the start though it was really hard, and I kept hitting walls and being bad and it was frustrating. I didn't feel the need to replay levels and do them better.",
        "One thing about the game is that you can choose whether you go through slowly and find all the collectibles and unlock difficult levels, go for mega points by having a big combo, or speedrunning. Different strokes for different folks but I was totally unsure about what I wanted! I wish I could have been told what to do in that regard, but that's just me.",
        "One last thing: I regret playing this on the switch. The graphics and framerate are bad and not in a good way. When I watched some gameplay from the PC version after finishing the game I was so shook!"

The same because you're metroidvania-ing around just like Zero mission or Super Metroid, fighting similar bosses, living your normal life. Gameplay-wise I did think to myself, this game is just like the others. But that's not a bad thing, it's a great formula.",
        "What it does differently is the vibe. This game is way more of a horror game than other ones - you can see where the blueprint for Metroid Dread is. There are some genuinely horrible & creepy moments. The first time you see the SA-X, or when you encounter a certain someone encased in ice, the introduction of one of the bosses towards the end where you first see its corpse... It's so good. Terrifying. The music really adds to it as well.",
        "It's way more linear in the sense that this computer tells you what to do at any point but I really appreciated that because I didn't enjoy in Super metroid how sometimes you had to decide on your own to go to a completely different sector to progress. It still left many things open in many cases so I still felt super smart finding my way around a lot of the time. There were like two points where I had to look up the answer because to be fair it was completely ridiculous. This one hole you have to find in the water sector is just so dumb, and the comments on the youtube video which shows the whole made me feel better about looking it up."

        "This is just the same as slay the spire. Instead it's got cute animals and great dialogue. One thing really nice about it is you play as three characters at once and get access to all three of their card decks, which means it's fun to pick and choose what you want.",
        "But it's definitely not as deep as slay the spire, and I wish it had an ascension system instead of just four difficulty modes. I also wish there were more obvious goals to complete in the game, instead of just winning 18 runs to unlock these dialogues.",
        "It was fun learning what was really broken in the game and what could be ignored. Like in slay the spire, card draw is super important, but in this game not so much - I would say energy is way more important. Also, movement is far more powerful than shielding. Pretty cool."

        "This game is so kooky and fun, and made with love. It has a great art direction, and fantastic characters. You play a larger man who dives in a special location which contains all the fish in the world and then sells them as sushi. It's a wild premise and one that I really enjoy. I love that you just get real life fish and literally everything can be eaten. Even the bosses are just sharks and shit (for the most part).",
        "Dave the character is just great, he is often sidelined and people are kinda rude to him but he just takes it in his stride. He loves what he does and has a great positive mindset and you just love to see it. He's surrounded by some other amazing characters, like the sushi chef. Their little dialogues are always great, and all the characters are beautifully characterised by these amazing short pixel art cutscenes. They are SUCH a pleasure to watch always.",
        "Going diving and catching new fish is also super fun. First time to see and catch a shark? Awesome. And the sushi restaurant parts are also great. They're super satisfying and making more and more money each day just feels so good.",
        "But I don't think I'd recommend this game to friends, because it is just sooooo slow. Diving in general is slow, and the story progresses really slowly. There are a million side quests, including this eco-app where you are encouraged to collect certain items. You get so little out of these quests, but I found myself obsessively getting everything all the time. It's meant to be a relatively chill game but I found myself optimising and making sure I could complete everything, which resulted in a bunch of super long dives.",
        "As the game goes on, it continuously piles on new mechanics, minigames, stuff that is clearly designed to keep you interested, as the core gameplay of shooting your harpoon at fish will get old quick. That's cool and all but by the end you have so much shit on, that it's almost overwhelming. I spent more time farming, transferring fish from the fish farm, asking myself which recipes I wanted to upgrade, playing these dumb phone minigames than actually diving. They just cram the game full of new content, and it's not even good. Like each new mechanic is so shallow that it gets old very quickly.",
        "This fucking phone game which is like tamagotchi was what did it for me. Like why am I spending my time on this. They literally give you a phone that you can check for all the various game content, including a sushi version of instagram, and you end up just staring at it for ages. I truly don't think this game is a comment on how we are addicted to our phones. I just think they put too much shit into the game and it got boring. This would have been way better on a smaller scale in my opinion."

You have to get lucky with the pills, because there isn't a good strategy for what to do when you get the wrong pills. You have to constantly go for vertical rows of 4 because the horizontal ones are just so risky.",

        "I was challenged to play all the Kingdom Hearts games in order and I got the collection on playstation so I thought, why the fuck not, let's play this spin off card game. Shit is WEIRD.",
        "It's an action game like the main one, except the attack you do depends on what your next card is. So in order to get good at the game you have to manage your cards, and also fight in a 3D arena like in the first game. All is well and good but then you meet some boss and it's impossible to get past. I personally struggled with this bitch Larxene (shown in pic) halfway through the game. She is such a bitch I hate her so much.",
        "It completely recycles all the assets from the first game and just tells another bewildering story. At this point I'm just letting it all wash over me. We are introduced to a bizarre shadowy organisation full of villains who all speak with an irritating sarcastic tone constantly. It's a wonder that any of these characters get anything done because they don't know how to communicate at all.",
        "At some point in the game I decided I was in too deep and committed to completing the whole thing. I was forced to look up tactics for how to cheese some of these bosses because towards the end those health bars end up being ridiculously big. Cheesing works to an extent, but I have to admit, I had to get kinda good at the game to beat the bosses... maybe it wasn't so bad.",
        "What was bad was realising that when I completed the game, there's a whole second playthrough with Riku with a new story and new battle mechanics. I had to play it. That shit was also bullshit, just like the main game, and there were fewer opportunities to cheese opponents. Still, I did it. Beating Ansem at the end was really hard but I did it. Mickey Mouse randomly appeared. Riku is caught being edgier than ever before. I can't get over how different this game is to Kingdom Hearts 1."

        "Now in terms of vibes this game is off the charts. There is so much fun nonsense to enjoy. Absolute highlight for me is Brentilda, Gruntilda's \"nice\" sister who is SUCH a bitch. She is just all over the map and all she does is hate on Gruntilda. It is so funny and I love the energy. Sometimes she's hiding in a corner somewhere and just pops up to say that Gruntilda is disgusting because she eats maggots for breakfast. Sets me off everytime.",
        "I have to say though. It's a terrible game, it's aged really badly. Collecting stuff isn't actually that fun. Having to collect all the music notes from the start whenever you die is miserable, and the jiggies are not signposted properly. The music is really good though, but of course I would say that as a lover of Donkey Kong 64 (proven to be a terrible game).",
        "I loved the final boss, because it was just a quiz. And Grunty is just so funny. Although, it turns out there's a difficult actual boss battle with her if you collect almost all the collectables. I just noped out of that one and watched it on youtube in the name of self-care."

The moment the early 2000s vibe hit like a truck during the opening I knew I was in for a treat. The thought of this being the coolest game ever as a child is just so funny at every point in the game.",

After that I was treated to a bewildering story and game with many difficulty spikes, many points where I had no idea where to go, and many times having to look up a walkthrough.",
        "The disney worlds, one of the most bewildering aspects of the game, are so tiny and bland it's funny. I was just amazed that they managed to secure the rights to all these characters and worlds. Although by the end, having had my standards set so low, I found myself forming opinions on them. Why does Neverland only take place on a boat? It was kinda cool that you can be a mermaid in Atlantica... and the music in Agrabah isn't too bad. Those gummi ship sections though, terrible.",

Actually I wondered if it was a little too over-engineered, taking away the magic a bit. But I couldn't deny that the little game design things they implemented were all great. Things like old paths closing off if it's definitely the wrong way to go, or pleasant music playing when you start solving a puzzle in the right way."

        "This game blew me away. Very hard to describe what it's about but here we go. You start the game inside an egg and you have to be born, but not before you get some kind of seed implanted inside of you. You are tasked by what appears to be a religious entity (the Centre) to rid the world of dust and bring about the Anodyne, something like a rapture (the word \"anodyne\" means painkiller). As you go around removing the evil dust, the seed inside you watches as you do your job. The evil dust affects the citizens of the weird and wonderful world, and you remove it, numbing the pain and \"clarifying\" things for them.",
        "As you go through the game, doing your job and meeting all these suffering people, you realise the game relates a lot to the human experience. There are many points in the game where you can draw parallels to how we grow up, how our parents affect us, our relationship with entities like \"the Centre\", and many many other things. The game is dripping with meaning.",
        "It also has an immaculate vibe. The world looks like a PS1 game, polygons and everything, but it also has nice lighting. The colour palette makes it look dreamy. It also looks dumb and trashy and low budget and I love that. There are also some 2D sections for when you shrink down to a miniscule size in order to clean the dust, and they are delightful. If you're interested, give <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SnkLnlsnY\">this track from an opening area</a> a listen"

        "One thing I look for the most in games is a good vibe, which is often from a combination of characters, environments, colour palettes, art, dialogue and most importantly, music. Sea of stars has just such a great vibe. I really enjoy the character designs and the environments and the lighting especially. There's an ability that lets you change the time of day and it looks soooo good, I've never seen anything like it.",
        "The music is also really good, I like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkEN4ATb-xo\">moorlands</a> music a lot.",
        "There's a few gameplay elements which make it not the best game ever. The battle system is a lot of fun, especially with the timed inputs and breaking of opponent's big moves, and I never groaned when I had a battle. However it doesn't have too much depth. It takes a long time before the characters learn any new attacks and when they do, they're never gamechanging. In fact I spent all the game using moonerang because it's simply the strongest attack. On top of that, one of the moves 'disorient' can really be abused to stop bosses ever doing their strong attack, which resulted in me missing all exciting animations from the final boss, which was a bit lame.",
        "Next part has some light story spoilers...",
        "The worst thing about this game though, is that the two main characters are plain and boring. They have no personality, they just go around winning battles and solving problems like boring heroes. How did they survive 10 years of isolation and training and then become perfectly well rounded heroes? The previous solstice warriors ended up not being well-rounded at all. The other characters are also pretty plain, with the exception of Resh'an, which was a genuine pleasant surprise. I appreciate that there was little dialogue, because it gave off those old fashioned SNES vibes, but it did mean that there was little to no character development. It's a shame because I like the designs.",
        "When it comes to world building, I have a couple of questions. If we're dealing with multiple timelines and universes, why are we just focusing on two of them? How did we end up consistently going between these two specifically using the vast sea of stars? Considering the name of the game is sea of stars, the whole concept isn't very well explored. I mean we got this insane, super cool warp sequence there, but even though we traverse the sea multiple times, we never see that again.",
        "One thing about the lore which I did enjoy were the stories told by Teaks. They're perfect fantasy fairytales which work really well with the minimal dialogue, set to nice music and revealed at points in the story when you haven't figured it out yourself yet.",
        "In conclusion, this is a game which does have that X factor which is so rare in the wealth of video games we are bombarded with these days, but it has some things holding it back from being one of my favourites. I did push through all 30 hours though, which says something"

This time for the first time I played on casual mode (as opposed to classic mode, where you have permadeath) and it GREATLY improved my gameplay experience. I didn't have to reset when someone got hit with a critical hit! I should have used this option the whole time. To balance it out, I also played on hard mode, which made the game more fun, although I was resentful that my playtime extended very long because of it. Also a little bit of me is unsatisfied because I switched it to normal difficulty for the final boss... I just ran out of patience.",
        "This game brings back 12 main characters from previous fire emblem games as the \"emblems\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. I am a total sucker for this kind of thing - references to older games, representation of different eras... I loved seeing Micaiah from Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, or Eirika from Sacred Stones. So cool. I just wish the emblems actually had personalities. They are all boring as hell.",

        "I love Pikmin with my whole heart. There's something special about it. The combination of the focus on nature, the soundtrack, the wacky characters, and the kinda dark elements combine to give it a certain X factor which is hard to pin down with words. When I think about whether games are good, they can get approval from me for a variety of reasons. Like Slay the spire is just great gameplay. But most of my favourite games just have great vibes.",
        "The vibe of pikmin is so fucking strong that it's insane, and the gameplay is good enough that it's fun to spend time in the game soaking up the vibe. The first pikmin arguably had the worst gameplay but the strongest vibe. The time limit, as well as harshness of the environment, and some highlights like the first encounters with specific bosses. Lots of bullshit with pikmin killing themselves, general difficulty. It is a great time and might be my favourite pikmin.",
        "The second pikmin game is a lot bigger and also has vibes in spades. The areas are super nice, music is fantastic (I love the piklopedia), and gameplay significantly improved with having two captains. The caves seemed pretty random though - like time stops when you're down there and then you've just got this ability to go back to the previous floor if you lose too many pikmin. I feel like it takes away from the general feeling of the game, and it's more like bonus content.",
        "Pikmin 3 is super interesting. It's fucking gorgeous, has beautiful areas and possibly the best music of all. It also does away with the caves, and instead just has a really big overworld, which brings back that pikmin 1 vibe a lot. I never liked how the treasures were just fruits though, that seemed pointless. It also added mission mode, which was the best thing ever in terms of gameplay - these super fun little challenge modes. The final boss was also very special.",
        "Now after 10 years we finally get Pikmin 4 and I have been excited for it, even more so than for Zelda. In terms of gameplay, everything is there. Quality of life changes to the max, meaning that pikmin actually do what they're told, all the pikmin content you could wish for. All the old bosses coming back, caves, hours of gameplay. I had a fun time collecting all the treasures and completing everything.",
        "But something's off. The game feels like a huge collection of content being thrown in. More is more! The caves are more content, the dandori challenges (like pikmin 3 mission mode) are great but integrated into the game like extra content. They brought back the (terrifying in pikmin 2) waterwraith and it felt empty. It just dropped two of them in the final dungeon. Doing that really takes away the special vibe of that particular boss. I realised that in pikmin 4, vibe was sacrificed for more content, and that this is true for many games these days.",
        "The quality of life changes &amp; powered up rewind function makes it so it's very easy to get through the game without losing pikmin, so stakes are way lower now. I think I miss the chaos of the first two pikmins where one misstep can cause your whole squad to get flattened without warning. Electricity immediately killing them, the gatling groinks, yellows throwing bombs back at you. There's something delicious about that.",
        "On top of that, the music isn't so great. The Olimar sidequest tracks are great, but otherwise it's gone a different direction: now it has ultra adaptive music (something the series is famous for and a big contributor to the X factor) but it's so adaptive to the point it's barely recognisable. There are multiple layers which fade in and out depending on what enemy you're fighting, what you're carrying etc. Nothing you can hum.",
        "They also retconned the lore, and it was \"all a dream\" or something. They had Louie be the bad guy but then cleared things up after, and there were no open questions left like in Pikmin 2. There was no weird shit like the Pikmin 3 final boss. And final complaint: I wish they integrated the night time/glow pikmin sections better.",
        "But to end on a positive, I really loved getting platinum medals in the dandori challenges, and those final ones were tough as nails. I still loved this game. I even painted a picture of Oatchi for my living room!"

For example, this game is where Bowser's personality was first defined!"

        "Playing this game felt a lot like playing Breath of the Wild back in 2017, although it has to be said: nothing can truly recreate that feeling of magic we all felt back then. It's undeniably a better game, but some of that magic is gone the second time around. It's super interesting because it's forcing me to reflect on why I enjoyed playing BotW more, despite it being emptier and more annoying. How we enjoy games really depends on so many things, not just the game itself. In this case, it was because there really wasn't anything like it before.",
        "Anyway here we are in 2023 playing Zelda again and it's a lot of fun. The new abilities are nice. I was actually in it for the new content, music, areas and surprises though. There was a lot to enjoy, but it really does rely on existing content a bit too much. I wish exploring Hyrule wasn't so similar to how it was before.",
        "I really loved some of the new stuff though. The new temples, great! Especially that gorgeous Lightning Temple music, hell yes. Getting from A to B using a ratchet flying machine, great. First time falling into a chasm? Terrifying. This gorgeous version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VbNjXSRRQU\">Lookout Landing</a> after you meet all the sages."

Luckily, a friend told me about a quest I should do somewhere near the beginning, and that was great because I got a +8 spear out of it, which made me super powerful. I also enjoyed using the spear at a weapon. I used that spear to get me through Margit and also two other big bosses.",

        "I mean where do I even begin. Anyone who knows me knows I love this game and it probably is my favourite game ever. I mean, come on. Imagine you're a nintendo fanboy and then they release a game with all your favourite nintendo characters in it, all your favourite nintendo music and in general all the fan service you could ever want. And the game is actually good. It's so good that I organise all the motherfucking tournaments for it in Berlin and compete in it myself even. This game is just the bees knees, it has everything. There are so many characters, and so of course I naturally gravitate towards my favourites. There's something for everyone here.",
        "And the game is actually so good. There are so many layers of depth! As a child I remember early smash games the difference between learning how to Up-B back to stage, or how to use roll and spotdodge, and not knowing that stuff. That was like level 1 smash. Fastforward to today and I'm on like level 10 smash, playing in competitive tournaments. Now it's all about specific match up knowledge, having a gameplan and changing your gameplan mid-game. It's about mind games and understanding what your opponent will do. It's an actual fighting game and it turns out I'm super into that. Playing in tournament has been so satisfying, and I have loved slowly getting better over the years.",
        "In fact I can only recommend to anyone to join the smash community. Going to tournaments is just so fun, and sure the community itself is full of nerds, and mostly they are boys, there are also a bunch of cool people, and there's no money involved. So it's an actual grassroots community, all just getting together for the love the game, and that is so cool. Now I'm a community leader and I do a lot of very fulfilling work for the community. It's nice and has inspired me to look for more community in my life.",
        "I personally main Peach because she is just stunning. Her vibes are great and her victory screens are hilarious. I love that she has the float mechanic, which makes her able to move unlike any other character. It also means she has a very good disadvantage, so I don't have to be frustrated about not being able to get back to stage. Early smash ultimate days I even got some great results with her, but that's because she was a monster in the early meta. These days, the meta has been overcrowded with bullshit characters and camping, but luckily it doesn't hinder too much my enjoyment of the local tournaments that I put on. That being said, he's hoping for a switch 2 edition which nerfs Steve!",
        "I'm not done talking about this game. Have you seen the soundtrack? There are over a thousand tracks. Each stage from each game franchise has a whole bunch of music from their respective games, and crucially, there are banger remixes of hundreds of these tracks. All my favourite nintendo games are represented here with some of the best remixes ever. What more could you possibly want?! Well, I guess a good online, but that's fine. Having a bad online just means that people are forced to come to my offline smash tournaments hehe"

Bayonetta herself is of course designed to be a 14 year old boy's wet dream, but craziest part of the game is just the camera, which zooms in on her vagina and boobs so often it's insane. Then it turns out her clothes are made out of her hair, and she needs those strands of magic hair to do big attacks, so of course she becomes naked as she fights. You can't make it up.",
        "Anyway. There's not actually inherently wrong with having sexualised women in video games. There was a time when this was an issue because that was all you got, but these days there's loads of great female representation so I'm not too bothered about this design. It's actually kinda fun and over the top. The game itself is also so needlessly dramatic, it's hilarious.",
        "I will say one thing though, the vibes of this game are very good. They are very unique and fabulous. The music is its whole new genre. It's like music for unfurling your butterfly wings to. It's sassy and maximalist and I have to say it's fucking great and suits Bayonetta perfectly. I also enjoy all the religious imagery in the game and all the monsters from heaven and hell. It's all kinda classy.",
        "I didn't really enjoy the hack and slash gameplay, and didn't really get good at the combos. This isn't my favourite genre of game."

This was the game of getting my brothers to do the scary bits for me. It's because this game is so moody! I was captivated.",

When the gorons hug you, the Deku tree dying, the whole of Jabu Jabu's belly, the part where the fat zora slowly moves over, seeing Kakariko as an adult, meeting the kokiri as an adult, stopping the rolling goron, the wild cutscene with sheik in Kakariko village, gerudo fucking fortress, all the little mini dungeons in ganon's tower, the FINAL BOSS I mean hello.",

This game taught me everything I knew back then about black culture in America, as well as gang violence and prostitution. There I was, a child, going around shooting gang members, having sex with prostitutes, I even remember becoming a pimp in one mission. Looking back I think it gave me a kind of baseline understanding of a bunch of real issues in America that was totally warped. You can just fuck a prostitute then kill her to get the money back, it's totally fucked up. I remember really enjoying the missions where you just drive round in a fire truck and put out fires. Because I was a child. And there I was, also expanding the gang's territory in these crazy shoot-outs in the streets.",

In order to do that though, I had to play the stories of all the other 7 characters, even though they were all completely unrelated. The game is split into four sections, and in each section you have to complete some story for each character. When I finally got to the fourth and final section, I just did Tressa's story then called it quits. Why? Because this game is fucking exhausting. It's so long. The boss battles take over an hour sometimes. I remember doing one of them while taking a bath, and deciding to get out of the bath before finishing the fight. Which is ridiculous if you think about it. I should be able to complete one boss fight in one bathtime. I feel like that's an unwritten rule that until this point has been largely respected.",

Why even have 8 stories like this if they don't interact? They could have built a beautiful world with tons of related characters and storylines but no it's super separated and therefore boring. And it makes no sense why they're all travelling together. This really pissed me off when trying to enjoy the story. For such a long game, having to play 8 very shallow stories with no meat to them was just lame.",

Something about being able to see the other levels from the various different points on the island is just cool. And I love the general sunny and positive vibe of the game. The piantas are all delightful, the missions are fun. SURE there is a lot of bullshit and I wouldn't recommend anyone to 100% like I did. But you can't deny the vibes are off the charts.",

I love how you can roll to go super fast and jump out of it, maintaining your speed. Actually this is kind of a speedrunning game! I even did all the speed challenges on all the levels to get the gold medals, and it was so hard! Donkey Kong games are unafraid to go there in terms of difficulty. Only being able to be hit twice is kinda hardcore if you think about it.",

The first level's music tells you everything you need to know about the vibe of the game. Then later on there's a world based on the Alps, then the African savannah, then some of the most gorgeous underwater levels ever, then this insane jungle island where the levels showcase harvest fruits, turning them into juice, putting them into moulds, freezing them to make ice lollies that the boss eats! Insane.",

JESUS! This game is dark. There were so many parts where I was scared as a child. Even the mask salesman with this face he pulls was scary. Everything about the Majora's Mask itself was terrifying. Like the it stares at you with wide-open eyes like a lemur, horrible. And most of all I was terrified of the aliens in Lon Lon Ranch. What the fuck.",

Also this game features one of the scariest zelda moments ever: the floating hands in the palace of twilight. Even as a teenager at this point I was fucking terrified.",

It took me many years to complete it, because I was too dumb as a child to know where I had to go next. Although I admit the game does not signpost where you should go. You are forced to roam the world and find stuff, which today is kinda unacceptable bad game design, but back then resulted in me putting the game down and coming back when I was a couple of years longer. I remember the boss key in Bottle Grotto was a hard barrier for me for YEARS.",

        "Huge game. I will never forget when this came out and I got it in the post two days early. I went to some school event and said to my friend Oscar 'I love playing as King Dedede' and he was so shook! The hype for this game was through the roof. There was this sick website where Sakurai revealed new stuff about the game every day. At some point I watched all the cutscenes of the subspace emissary from the Japanese release out of pure hype, spoiling everything for myself. The build up was feverish.",
        "I loved the Subspace Emissary. All my favourite nintendo characters all coming together in a massive adventure mode? Insane. I loved that you had to do the different levels with different characters, and I loved that they all teamed up, like Yoshi and Link, or Kirby and Peach, or Lucas and Pokemon Trainer, or Samus and Pikachu. That stuff gave me life. My favourite character, Ice Climbers, even got a little cameo towards the end and I loved it. I was devastated you only have them for one level, and that level with Meta Knight, who I hated.",
        "This was the first smash game with an online mode, and looking back, that thing was SHIT. But I still played it. The connection terrible, but I still played it and loved it. I mained Ice Climbers and also Yoshi. I remember also seeing some competitive smash on youtube at that point, but I wasn't interested in that just yet.",
        "In melee each represented video game got one or two music tracks for their respective stages. That was so fucking cool. But one of the amazing things about brawl is that each franchise got a whole bunch of music!! Actual remixes of all my favourite tunes to suit an upbeat battle theme. There is so much good shit! In legendary Stickerbrush Symphony remix, the Dark World remix, With Mila's Divine Protection, which was THE track of subspace emissary. Fucking Unfounded Revenge, Underground Theme, Luigi Circuit, Ending Yoshi's Story, Butter Building, Meta Knight's Revenge, Fire Field. And you unlocked them with CD items! Seeing one of those was crazy. Drop everything and get that fucking CD!!"

All the four main areas have amazing music themes in many variations. My favourite is definitely Mafia Town, but I love them all. There is nothing that does spooky forest music like Subcon Forest."

That alone gives this game a special flavour that wasn't present in New Horizons. In this game you could somewhat customise the island which was awesome"

In chapter 1 an unexpected and horrible twist awaits you, with the most amazing music to accompany it. Chapter 3 puts you in the POV of a monkey who is tortured and enslaved for entertainment. Chapter 6 well, if you know you know. Chapter 8, right at the end of this Japan-only obscure-ass game, is New Pork City, the stage from Smash! Incredible that New Pork City of all places is represented in Smash.",

But what makes this game truly special is its soundtrack. It sounds unlike anything else and I am obsessed. Over in the music section of this website you can find the mixes I made - I did a mix of this soundtrack and just put every single track in, resulting in an almost 3-hour extravaganza. It's just that good.",

Best is playing on original hardware, because the battles feature a rhythm game system which works better with buttons, but emulation on your PC will work fine too. Do yourselves a favour and get to know where this obscure smash character Lucas comes from, it's well worth your time."

I loved all of the locations, I loved spending time going round with all the characters collecting a bunch of shit. I adored the music, the nonsense minigames, the jank. I accepted all the bullshit this game has to offer with grace because it was magical. I loved Lanky Kong and also Tiny Kong. Crystal Caves was my favourite level, possibly because I didn't know about it for many years! When I eventually got all the golden bananas, it felt like a monumental achievement. And can we talk about the legendary soundbite 'Ohhhhh banana!'. Classic.",

I remember playing this together with my friend Claire and she was truly shook by the imagery of this last part. I mean I hate to spoil the game a bit but if you play the game, you understand. Honestly, Giygas is very yonic and is very much giving 'vagina', and I totally agree with all the theories that the swirling red shape is a fetus.

This one also massively expands on the story and it's delightful. Honestly this game is kinda iconic. Also, it has this amazing multiplayer mode of which I have fond memories. Me and a flatmate Heather would play it in our student halls of residence, in the hallway so we could connect our computers somehow. The puzzle where you crash both robots in the air against each other? Genius."

Eventually though, more and more people at school quit it because they saw it for what it really was: a soulless money making scheme. I eventually got the memo and deleted it, but not before I spend 5 pounds on a decorative tea house for my farm. Why the fuck did I do that? It was an eye opening moment that really turned me off of games with microtransactions forever after."

        "This is actually one of the ultimate party games and nobody can convince me otherwise. The concept of having springy arms and fighting like that is hilarious, why the fuck not, and the game is wacky enough to make it fun. Also, in terms of being a competitive fighting game, it's surprisingly deep! Infinite different combinations of arms mean lots of strategies and stuff like that. I once commentating an online ARMS tournament and learned so much shit about all the different strats, it was sick. Tragically the scene isn't too big so getting good at the game isn't really a thing but it remains a hilarious party game (with motion controls of course).",
        "Personally I enjoyed Lola Pop, even though she's the most basic character with no lore. She's just a clown who likes sweets and can inflate like a balloon like Lanky Kong. I also LOVE the main theme with the choir, what an absolute banger. There are also a number of other choice tracks in the soundtrack, like the credits theme or Mechanica's level. I made a mix for it, you can download it in the music section!"

It looks great and is a beautiful reimagining of how DKC looks, the music is pretty good and the game is full of great moments. The spider level is genuinely scary, the factory levels are super cool, World 4 is just the super fun minecart and rocket barrel levels, which are great, and this game invented the amazing silhouette levels. The sunset level was so inspiring that I painted a picture of it for my house.",
        "The game is also one of the best platformers ever, the rolling mechanic is so cool, because if you jump from a roll you keep the momentum, and it lets you fly through levels at breakneck speeds. After you beat the game you can try and speedrun the levels for these medals and I loved doing that! This was one of the only times I really got into the doing things fast aspect of gaming. Otherwise generally the game is kinda hard with only 2 health points. I remember this game taught me to git gud at platformers.",
        "Also this game is great because everything has a sensible context. Like there are no floating platforms, but rather all the platforms are part of other structures that make sense in the context of the level. And you have to really pay attention to the environment because there are these puzzle pieces hidden everywhere in secret nooks and crannies. Man, this game also taught me to find secrets! By the end I was able to spot all the clues for hidden areas like it was nothing. Platformers since this game have got nothing on me, I can find all the secrets. Unless they're bullshit. Luckily, in this game secrets are never bullshit, they are always somehow signposted. Great game design, love it"

When I had to make a team name I thought 'Tileteam' would be great because I was called Tilehurst, but then it called it 'Team Tileteam', which I also ended up loving, fuck it.",

An actual story, not the very weak story of normal mainline games, and an entirely new kind of game that I'd never seen before. I loved it. I remember having a third party member, a Ledyba called Mavis who was genuinely an excellent addition to the team because she knew a confuse move. I was devastated when the two main guys go on a solo trip half way through because I couldn't bring Mavis along. But I was delighted when I beat the game and saw that there was a ton of other stuff to do, and now I could evolve all my pokemon! So good!",

The new ones, Studiopolis, Press Garden, Mirage Saloon and Titanic Monarch are all 10/10 they just smashed it. They look fantastic and the music is top notch. The MUSIC!!!",

Somehow he ended up writing the music for an official Sonic game and he fucking knocked it out of the park. He also remixed all these old tracks with such love, and for the new act 2 versions of a few of them, went ham on a remixed version of them. I just adore Green Hill's act 2, as well Oil Ocean's.

Being able to fully visualise the pokemon just like in the cartoon was just amazing. I remember loving making little teams of all my favourite pokemon and playing through the gyms and other battles. There was a cool rental system where you could take any pokemon at level 50, with inevitably shit moves, but whatever, it was its own kind of challenge trying to beat the game with these shit pokemon. During this time I didn't have the hardware to connect my gameboy to the N64 so the rentals were all I had but I was satisfied.",

        "When I talk about vibes in video games, I'm talking about how close other video games achieve the status of ultimate vibe like Hollow Knight. This game is such a vibe it's insane. There are endless 'ambience and music from Hollow Knight for studying' compilations on youtube for a reason. The music is so sombre and peaceful and unlike anything else really. Then when the boss music hits, it's fucking great, it's dramatic but still fits the vibe of the gloomy caves. When I listen to tracks like 'Hornet battle' I enjoy how it sounds like baroque music.",
        "Specifically I love the main Crossroads area, Greenpath and the City of Tears. The music is stunning, and also the game looks amazing. The artstyle is somewhere between creepy and cute and they nail it. I truly don't think another 2D platformer can look as good as this.",
        "Gameplay-wise this game is also a 10. It's super open, meaning you can go anywhere really, and for a metroidvania you'd think that would be a problem but it straight up isn't. At some point you learn about the goal of the game and you have some directions on the map but all in all it's just about vibing through the various locations at your leisure and finding all this cool shit. At some point everything changes when you can double jump and you just want to go through the whole world again looking for secrets.",
        "The combat is sooooo satisfying! You have loads of short, fast attacks, but the enemies have lots of health so you have to hit them many times. But if you get good at it, you can kill stuff quickly with a flurry of blows and it feels great. The bosses are not your standard hit-them-three-times affair, but rather require you to fit in as many of these tiny hits in as possible between attacks. When you get hit yourself you it feels BAD, like the whole screen goes black and it HURTS. Sound design really helps with that and no game nails sound design like this one.",
        "There's also just tons of fun stuff to find and see. The game can keep going forever if you want. I personally was never able to defeat the Radiance and to this day I feel bad about it, but that hasn't stopped me from replaying this game 2 times and getting enjoyment out of it that way. Also did I mention that all the characters in this game are bugs? It's an insect game! And it has INSANE lore. Genuinely worth getting into those hour long deep dives into the lore because it is sooooo detailed."

I played this game so much because it has an absolutely banger single player mode. You go around doing all these races, there's a great hub world to go around with lots of challenges, and the story is all about defeating the ugly-ass Wizpig by beating him in a race. Love it. That wizpig race was randomly so fucking hard. But if you beat it you unlocked the space levels!!! Nothing was more exciting for me than after years to finally see the lighthouse turn into a rocket.",
        "I love and cherish all of the racetracks and know them all like the back of my hand. I know all the shortcuts. Dear reader, you cannot defeat me at this game because I am a pro. Later in life I even learned how to go fast by tapping the accelerator button, and beat all the staff ghosts. This might be the first game I got good at. And unlike Mario Kart, there are no bitch-ass blue shells to make you lose even if you're the better racer. This game isn't socialist.",
        "But no, the reason this game is one of the greatest of all time is its soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope who did Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. It's iconic. All the tracks are timeless. I named my youtube channel 'Darkmooncaverns19' after the space-themed level on the same name. I fucking love these in particular: Fossil Canyon, Hot Top Volcano, Walrus Cove, Whale Bay, Pirate Lagoon, Boulder Canyon, Greenwood Village, Haunted Woods, Spacedust Alley, Darkmoon Caverns, Spaceport Alpha. I realise that's almost all of them but YEAH I just love them all. Fuck it. The music is perfect. The LOBBY MUSIC alone might just be the best song in the whole game.",

        "This game is so bullshit. I can't believe they done did dirty Pokemon like that. It looks like shit, doesn't perform well on the switch and is an all-round disappointment. This is where it really dawned on me how little GameFreak care about these games. I found it devastating that so many people bought this as well... it's all just very upsetting.",
        "It has some things that I like - as usual Pokemon continues to come up with excellently ugly and hilarious Pokemon designs. Cramorant, Centiscorch, Sinistea, Falinks, Stonjourner, Eiscue, all great. Also I lowkey enjoy Barraskewda. And the dinosaurs are SO UGLY I love it. I also fucking loved the Gigantamax thing, like what were they thinking? Some of the designs are so funny. Very entertaining.",
        "The soundtrack is miserable. They tried to go for something special with the music for the legendary pokemon but it sounds cheap and shit. There is one notable exception though: when you start a gym leader battle in the stadium. HOLY that's a great moment and the music goes hard. But then after a while there's this crowd singing along and it sounds like shit again. But for a minute or two, I was carried away by the excitement."

The undergrowth looks so good, the water looks amazing, and the levels are large and fun and full of stuff. No caves but it doesn't need them!",
        "This time there are three captains meaning there is plenty of opportunity for efficient work between them, which is great. I remember attempting something like an 8 day playthrough and got a 12 day in the end, which is pretty good.",
        "I think this is the most accessible Pikmin game and I've made several friends play it. I can only recommend it to people interested in the series! Maybe it doesn't have the wild and raw vibes of the first two games but it has a bunch of quality of life changes that make it seem so much less bullshit. The vibes are different but there's still those creepy undertones, especially with that final boss. The music is stunning.",
        "This game also features a hell of a lot of beautifully rendered HD fruit. It's so nice to admire all the fruit at the end of the day. No idea why they went for fruit but it's great. The running out of juice thing is a total joke though."

        "This game totally has its merits: another stunning soundtrack that fits the vibe perfectly being the main one. However it really misses out on a big opportunity: making the player strategise about which pikmin to use. The Pikmin are just available in each level for you to find and use, there's not making your own Pikmin. As a result, you always have the colour you need. Part of the magic of pikmin is selecting your squad and solving puzzles with that, but in this game you just go through the levels and follow the motions. There's not puzzle or strategy really. The minigame between levels is lame, but the bosses are kinda fun!",
        "I would only recommend this to hardcore Pikmin fans. There's not much meat on the bone, and it could have been something so much better. Soundtrack is great though, and I made a mix of it in the music section so check that out."

We had this for 10 years and in that time it carried me through so many party situations. It's just the ideal party game, what can I say. It's accessible for new players but also great if you're good at it.",
        "The base game back on the Wii U was awesome back then. Back then, I was excited about the anti-gravity, which I now realise is a total gimmick. You don't even realise you're upside down most of the time! After many years, I did get bored of those same tracks though. I will also say that those first tracks weren't as great as later ones, but maybe that's because I've just played them to death.",
        "Then, they released some awesome DLC with those banger F-Zero tracks, as well as Animal Crossing, which I love. It was like breathing new life into this old game. Then they went ahead and did it AGAIN, with an insane battle pass which included twice as many tracks. They brought back tons of old favourites, as bunch of surprisingly good city tracks from Mario Kart Tour, and some new ones. I loved it. I love that they went for that. Once again, new life was breathed into it and here we are on a new console 10 years later, still playing it.",
        "The music is so good, I can't even describe. They got a jazz fusion band to make all the songs and they fucking nailed it! Mario Kart music is already great but they took it to the next level with this OST and I am obsessed. The remixes of old favourites in particular are amazing. In the 'misc' section of this website I actually ranked all of this games tracks, and there are a lot of them, so if you want more detailed thoughts, go check that out."

        "OK I know this game has a bunch of problems but that didn't stop me from loving it with all my heart. Genuinely one of my favourite Fire Emblems! Let's start with the negatives and get them out of the way. The story is ass. All three versions of the game have anticlimactic endings, and do not even attempt to tie up loose ends. Lots of lost potential for an otherwise alright premise. Many of the characters are ridiculous, for example Camilla, who is a sexualised crazy lady who constantly flirts with you (her sibling!). She has this strap of some material that runs between her huge knockers which I can only imagine is super uncomfortable. And she has a hole in her armour to show of her thong. OK I'll shut up about her. Corrin, the main character is the most bland and boring character ever. So plain. FE protagonists tend to be like this but they are the worst by far.",
        "Also what the fuck is going on with the having children in an alternate universe and having them join the team as adults? Who thought of that?? The children mechanic is shamelessly copied from Awakening and they didn't even bother trying to explain it. Whatever, if it means that the fans can flirt with their favourite characters (read: touch Camilla's boobs with the stylus), then it's worth it. This game really is a mess.",
        "Anyway, I love it. The main reason is I think that this soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. It is huge and expansive, and beautifully made. It's honestly gorgeous. The world is split into two, a more folky/celtic vibe in the west and a more oriental vibe in the east, and these two styles are well represented in the music. I love the compositions, especially with the choice of chord progressions. Some faves include Past Light, Dusk Falls, Dark Wastes, Alight, Land Below, Road Token, Glory/Ruin. They are just so good. I made a really good mix of this music, available for download on the music page, which I listen to a lot to this day. It's great for long walks in nature.",
        "I did play all three versions through to the end, which all things considered really is saying something. I really enjoyed the game in terms of its mechanics and strategy. I of course had my favourite characters (Oboro) and my OP characters (Velouria) and it's a delight to pick and choose your main peeps for the team. Ugh what can I say I just really love this game."

This japanese-style cel-shaded goodness still looks perfect today, and that's because this game is timeless. It's epic and it's a classic! In the story you play as the sun god Amaterasu who is reincarnated as an awesome magical wolf, which on its own is sick (twilight princess eat your heart out this came out first!), but then you're taken down this wild rabbit hole of a story based on Japanese folklore.",
        "There are so many points in the game that I love. When you dramatically run with Kimiko's body to the shrine, when you beat Orochi and realise this game is far from over, those awesome Owl bosses, the snow area in general, shrinking down inside the city, the jiggly boob lady who turns out to not be who you think she is, the gender ambiguous villain character, the final boss. so much to enjoy.",

It makes it more and more uncomfortable as you go, and the only real reason to continue is to see all the content in the game, even if that means commiting genocide.

Like in DS you could play as 5 different babies, but here it's just Baby Mario. And there's so little variety in terms of gameplay and vibes. It's only new mechanic is having big eggs. And then there's this really annoying reveal for the final world where yoshi's island is just a planet. It's just not how I had it in my mind. The music is also disappointing. It has a beautiful title theme but then all the rest is just slight variations of that theme and not in a particularly nice way."

The soundtrack has been remade and it just sounds like shit. The soundfont sounds bad. There are new music tracks for some of the levels, because the original used the same music for multiple levels, but it just doesn't feel right to make those replacements. They got rid of Pirate Lagoon entirely what the fuck.",

They also changed the mechanics, especially of the hovercraft, and it's just worse. I also don't like the new silver coin challenge with the touchscreen, I preferred the old one.

You could play games to early coins and buy and sell stuff. I loved all the games and loved my little Chia called Frozenbluixi. My favourite game was Ice Cream Factory. The website had a bunch of cool stuff with other players, like a whole economy and stuff, but I didn't really engage with that. Neopets is where I had my first personal website though! They had a little HTML tutorial for the profile page and I learned some important life skills. Shoutouts to Neopets man, and to my dying, still alive Neopets. I'm sorry I can't feed you, but I can't find my password."

After several failed attempts, I got one incredible wonder run where I almost got to the end (having previously beaten the first boss like twice only). I played this one run for ages and everything was hanging on it, and then I lost. I tried to play another one but I could never reach those heights again. I blew it!
