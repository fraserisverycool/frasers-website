        "I've been loving this classic album from Tears for Fears! There are the famous songs like 'Shout' and 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' and they're great but it's all about the album tracks. My favourite is 'The Working Hour' with its amazing saxophone. It's such a great vibe. You've also got the amazing 'Head Over Heels' which has such an amazing ending, followed by a very ambient and cerebral final track. It's such a great album for the end of the evening."

        "Wow, after loving the previous album so much, here I am again, my world rocked from another Natalia record. In this one, it feels like she's playing the role of an alter-ego called 'cancionera'. Upon closer thought I realise she's talking to the version of herself which is a famous singer. Sometimes it feels like the songs are directed to another person but what if it's just her?",
        "She's got these beautiful upbeat and happy songs like 'Cocos en la playa' which feel more like putting on a smiley face to deal with the sad feelings. It feels like she's coping. In fact that track feels more like a 'fuck this I'm going to the beach' because she's tired of social media and fame and all that shit. Instead she's gonna go smoke a joint on the beach, get naked and chat with the moon. 'El Coconito' is literally about wanting to feed corn to a turkey but there's no corn.",
        "But she also bares all on the sad songs, which I love the most because I'm a sucker. 'Luna Cresciente' the perfect example: vibes-wise it feels like a huge black bird flying in the night. It's a song about longing and then sinks into this beautiful outro track. I love it. I love this whole album, it's different from the previous one but equally as stunning and the fun songs equally as fun. Each time I listen to it, I love it even more.",
        "I've even gone and compiled a list of things I love most about each track - here they are!",
        "Apertura Cancionera - starting off the album with 8 seconds of silence.",
        "Cancionera - the part when the piano solo comes in, delicious.",
        "Cocos en la Playa - the porrito reveal.",
        "Como Quisiera Quererte - when she screams 'todas mis golondrinas van confudidas al mar!",
        "Amor Clandestino - the switch from minor to major with the cheeky knowing looks on their faces.",
        "Mascaritas de Cristal - when she leans forwards and gets to the point: 'quiero ver zu verdad'.",
        "El Coconito - the gymnastics they do with their mouths on 'pero ahora no hay'.",
        "El Palomo y La Negra - just that it's a party in the middle of the album.",
        "Cariñito de Acapulco - when she calls out 'Ay mamita Guadalupe!!'.",
        "La Bruja - singing 'me agarra la bruja' like she's about collapse.",
        "Luna Creciente - 'borracha de amar' over the amazing 3 time guitar parts from Hermanos Gutierrez.",

She was insanely young when she released this but she had already perfected the staring into the distance while singing look.

It starts with the honestly bewilderingly different 'Soothing', which judging from the video, is about lesbian sex, then the other 8 tracks are all something very different, normal Laura-style sing song guitar tracks. I really love 'Nouel' in particular. The whole thing of the album is femininity and the whole thing reads very queer. I can only assume that this is from when she had a lesbian affair before settling with her current baby daddy"

This is their second and I think my favourite album. It's got such beautiful instrumentation, lots of windchimes, wooden sticks and samples of an old man reading. I just heard them close with 'Woodcat' which is kind of a wild choice but it totally worked. I always loved the song 'Stories' because it's so intense and feels like you're running away. Then straight after is 'Jenny Again' which is such a wild and sad story. Actually this song is why I love the name 'Jenny'. The whole second half of the album is just beautiful song after beautiful song. And I especially love the eerie tone of the last two tracks"

Imagine you get your big break and your first signed release is a small concept album about an android who falls in love with a human, then gets persecuted by the totalitarian regime for it. The android in question, Cindi Mayweather, an alpha platinum 3000, gets captures during 'Many Moons' (make sure to watch the music video for that, it's wild), and becomes a revolutionary during 'Sincerely, Jane' which is by the way the most ambitious and fascinating song she ever made. I actually love it so much. When you read the lyrics it becomes clear that it's more than just a sci-fi story though. She's talking about current topics, and that is hugely relevant. Anyway once you've appreciated these amazing tracks go blow your minds by listening to the follow-up, The ArchAndroid"

        "This is her magnus opus. It's an insanely ambitious sci-fi concept album about a character that she plays, Cindi Mayweather, an android who is persecuted for falling in love with a human. The story follows on from her previous EP 'Metropolis' and is about Cindi discovering herself, rallying the troops and fulfilling her destiny as the ArchAndroid. As you listen to the album though it becomes clear that being an android is actually just a metaphor for being the 'other'. For example being a woman, or being black, or being queer. How would we treat androids if they were going around society stealing our husbands? It's a pretty interesting thought.",
        "In the story, she hopes to lead the people to 'BaBobByeYa', some kind of utopia where there is no police brutality, and this album is about her journey to do that. God this album is just drenched in such a magical vibe, definitely because of the sci-fi setting, although it is definitely rooted in black music, hip hop and soul.",
        "I love the first couple of tracks, how they blend into each other. 'Locked Inside' is actually woke as fuck, and I love the looping chords. 'Mushrooms & Roses' I love because it's where she finds community, and also queer love. I also think it's a bit like, take psychedelics once and then realise you want to change the world.",
        "The second half of the album has a dud in it, 'Make The Bus'. Why did Of Montreal muscle their way into this perfect album like this. It's a disappointment and I often skip it. But then it heads into the most magical final tracks of the album where Cindi realises her duty as a revolutionary leader. 'Say You'll Go' straight up has Clair de Lune in it which is just so nice. And I can't say exactly why but the vibe of this track really reminds me of the film 'Melancholia', a film which I regularly think about.",
        "And finally there is this insane orchestral overture at the end to finish off the album. It's so dramatic and beautiful, and it elevates the album into some kind of epic tale. I love it. This is one of my favourite albums of all time, for sure"

        "This follow-up album takes the sci-fi concept from her previous works and tells the story of Cindi Mayweather from a different angle, her growing up and learning about her place in the world. It's like an origin story, and it serves to further link the 'otherness' that she feels with her 'androidness'. In this album she is inspired by great artists, by ghetto women and also comes to terms with her queerness.",
        "I love it so much. It isn't quite as ambitious as the ArchAndroid but I really love the new tone she strikes, and some of these tracks are just so, so good. The opener with Prince is great, especially the ending, then there is the incredible 'Q.U.E.E.N.'. This is where I first got into Erykah Badu! It's all thanks to Janelle Monáe. Playing with the ambiguity between the words 'queen' and 'queer' is genius, and the songs features this amazing breakdown before the rap at the end which I love. I mean, great production.",
        "These albums are split into suites and the second suite of the album is one of my favourites of this whole series. It's less bombastic than the first half but it's just beautiful song following by beautiful song. I just love the chord progressions in 'Ghetto Woman', 'Can't Live Without Your Love', and especially 'Dorothy Dandridge Eyes', which is also how I got into Esperanza Spalding! Thank you Janelle again!!",

        "To tell you I was hyped for this release would be a huge understatement, not least because she dropped a whole ass film to go with it. Talk about ambition! I have to say though, I was disappointed that this release doesn't explicitly continue the story of Cindi Mayweather from her previous concept albums, but rather offers a more generic view of otherness through the lens of the present. At first I thought she was dumbing things down a bit, but I ended up coming round to this album. I can only imagine how it must feel for her, having released this complicated series of stories - she must have felt a lot of pressure to continue, when actually she wanted to write songs about how she was feeling in the moment.",
        "This album still does have that concept album vibe, with the same sci-fi beats so I am satisfied, although it's not as explicit as before. One thing that's special about this though is that it's the album where she officially came out as queer - up until this point it was just hinted at, but now she goes hard in on that. If I were to describe the vibe of this album is would be having a party with your friends from marginalised groups, smiling, laughing, dancing and also crying because we're all screwed. I specifically really got into the song 'Screwed' for one summer in 2019..."

        "As a Janelle Monáe mega-fan I was less hyped for this release because it was clear she is drifting away from her ambitious sci-fi concept albums, and when this dropped I didn't even like it. I thought, this is just an album about having fun, having sex and enjoying being rich, which she is now. She's clearly spent a lot of time with a bunch of awesome queer black people and just wanted to make an album about how great her life is at the moment. It's like the song 'Wondaland' from the ArchAndroid, but I don't think it's like 'BaBopByeYa', like we haven't made it yet. Still, as usual with Janelle I came round to it. Even though the instrumentation is less lush and it's more trap/hip hop than soul, it has some really great moments. She totally slays on 'Haute' and there's this great performance she did of it on youtube where she just looks so good dancing to that song. And I love the song 'Only Have Eyes 42'. She's clearly in her polyamory phase! I'm sure that will fall apart, like all polyamorous relationships do. Looking forward to the next album at least!"

The most glaring example is 'Kanske...' which notably worse now... but it's fine, it just makes my CD of the original that much more valuable!",

This also has an all-time favourite 'Postcard to Nina' about going to Berlin (!) to meet with a penpal who makes him pretend to be her boyfriend so she can be with her girlfriend. In the re-released version he adds a bonus track which revisits the story of Nina and it's just perfect. It pulls at my heartstrings every time and I would pay anything to see it live"

The second track is just her with a double bass, wild. 'Back of a Truck' is like a gospel anthem, and 'Pavlov's Daughter' is so good just in general. I love the little drum machine at the start before it gets going"

        "The mother of all Regina albums, and one of my favourite albums of all time. This is her breakout and features some of the most prescient and thoughtful songs she's ever written. This had me learning how to play 'Ode to Divorce' on the piano as a 13 year old singing to myself 'I need your money!'. I also learned how to play 'Somedays' and 'Ghost of Corporate Future' which I love so so much. Each one tells its own kind of specific story, and each time they come with important life lessons. 'Chemo Limo' is about a woman who rents a limousine instead of spending money on chemotherapy so that she can go out in style with her four kids. The song is a wild ride"

They're clearly having a lot of fun doing it, which is what makes it so delightful. I also feel like this album is the blueprint for a lot of their future stuff.

'Graduation' is super funny, 'Fish Bowl' has this shoegaze section, I'm obsessed, 'Big City' is literally city pop and I love city pop. 'Break' is so real. And they partly filmed the video in Berlin! 'Lipslap' is full of hilarious lyrics ('I'm not one to lip read and you don't come with subtitles!'), 'Try Me' is hilarious because of the 'business, dancing, throwing a party with you!' line, 'Paintbrush' is also hilarious because it's in Japanese except for the word 'Paintbrush', and 'Trampoline' is just a straight up BOP.

They have gone from bubblegum pop to noise rock and holy shit it was so exciting. This album exposes what was lying underneath the happy-go-lucky vibes and lyrics of their old stuff and suggests that they were all mentally ill the whole time and putting on a face! 'Time Today', which I love, as well as 'Visiting Hours' both take place in a mental hospital, and at two points in the album there are moments were everything breaks down into horrible noise, complete with screaming and gunshots. But that doesn't mean the album has gone full sicko mode, the video game influences and pop vibes from their old stuff is still well and truly there, and there are a number of tracks which are even nice! I love the ending of 'Dear Future Self' and of course 'Swimming'.

Something about my favourite track being 'After The Fall', referring to the previous album 'The Fall' which I didn't vibe all as much with, is kind poetic. It's got this beautiful and hypnotic guitar loop and I love it. A second totally exceptional track is the final one 'All A Dream' which is longer than your average Norah track and I love it. Such a special and unique vibe. Also this is the time when she released a single about murder"

'Meadowlarks' is the kind of song you sing to the sea when standing on a windy cliff. I also have to recommend the new version they brought out of this which includes a bunch of tracks from this period, including the fantastic Sun Giant EP. I love in particular 'Drops in the River', 'In the Hot Hot Rays', 'Icicle Tusk' and this cover of an old song 'Silver Dagger'. I genuinely listen to this stuff a lot still to this day"

The wild saxophone part of 'An Argument' I didn't like at first but it was just my first exposure to noisy shit. Coming around to this track later on is what prepared me for KKB's 'Only Acting'.

Even 'Hot Dreams', a song I genuinely love for its sickly sugary horror vibe, I can't really put on, because the first line is 'I wanna dance with a black woman'. This guy really plays the role of a seedy criminal shithead who visits prostitutes and hates his wife and that actively comes through in the lyrics. When I went to see him live I was worried he would actually be like that in real life, and although he certainly looks the part, he is just a good musician, and creepy shit and ghost stories are just his jam. I do feel like you have to be a fucked up kinda person to write 'Run from Me' though. I don't know what's going on really."

He always celebrates nature, and this album does that the most of his albums. It's quite simple and pure. One song, 'Where Do My Bluebird Fly' he doesn't perform anymore because it's about suspicion towards an ex-girlfriend who he is now over. Nonetheless when he DID perform one of the many times I've seen him, it was so so so shocking and intense"

I don't claim to come even close to figuring out what's going on in Aldous's mind but what matters is that this album has great moments. It's peaceful and weird. If I were to equate this album with a Nintendo franchise it would be pikmin. I especially enjoy the very final track which features the guy from Sleaford Mods, which I read was an awkward collaboration. But whatever I love it when she reharmonises the song at the end with the guitar, it sounds so melancholic"

        "My first exposure to Michael Kiwanuka was 'Home Again' which I decided was beautiful and stunning. Little did I know that the rest of his discography is even more beautiful and stunning that this. I don't often listen to this first album because I find it doesn't tackle the real issues like the newer stuff, but I have a special love for it because it was my entryway into his world. This particular album wasn't produced by the legend Inflo (all his others were) but it still has this classic vintage, 70s singer songwriter feel that I love. And it's sad songs, I love sad songs. This album is gorgeous, don't be afraid to put it on when having sunday brunch. It's sad but in a melancholic way, also uplifting. I also want to point out an amazing one-off single he did after this album called 'You've Got Nothing To Lose', please go watch the music video for it."

Inflo makes this insanely delicious vintage vibe that works so well with Michael's songs.",
        "And wow his songs are so good! I love that he kicks of the album with a 10 minute masterpiece... 'Cold Little Heart' takes use through an odyssey of different thoughts and feelings and it never gets boring. It's music to stop and think about your life to. Then there is the absolutely stunning 'Falling' with its wailing, hanging piano notes, and the hypnotic 'Love & Hate' which I was obsessed with for a long time. Things really escalate on 'Rule The World' and 'Father's Child'. These are songs to cry to for sure. And then I just adore the final song. It's so simple and straightforward compared to the comparatively complex music before it and it feels like relief, like resting after lengthy emotional turmoil. I also really relate to the lyrics about not being able to love. I feel like Michael understands me when I say I feel like a heartless bastard. God I love this album so much"

        "This is that lengthy and meaty Michael Kiwanuka album I always wanted. Love & Hate is stunning and arguably the best one but it's only got 10 songs, here though we hear Michael just go nuts doing his own special brand of sad songs. That being said we start off with a happy song! 'You Ain't The Problem' is so good. It's a party. It's an instant-fall-in-love-with-the-album situation when you hear it. But no worries we're getting our classic melancholic, colourful, gorgeous tracks as well. 'Piano Joint' is the blueprint for the next album I think, and I love it. It's also got an intro before it and an interlude after it, which is something common in this album and honestly I'm all for it. It makes the album feel like one long continuous experience. Then I have to give special props to the last five tracks of the album. They are devastating. With 'Final Days' you understand what kind of place he's in. The absolute stunner though is the final track 'Light' which masquerades as a happy, hopeful and uplifting song, then transforms towards the end into the heartbreak that we know so well from Michael"

        "I've been hypnotised by the song 'Small Changes' the most. It sounds like he is singing that song with tears in his eyes. Then there is the dark and harmonic 'Rebel Soul' which has such a lush outro. He is really coming out with amazing chord sequences (my weakness) for these tracks and I am addicted. This is never more so the case than on 'Lowdown (part ii)' where the relatively upbeat first part collapses into a sublime string-based sequence of soulful chords. It sounds like the music that plays in a film when the character realises something life-changing or learns something devastating. In the context of the lyrics of the first part I imagine it as the music that plays when you hit rock bottom. Then, towards the end the tempo slows down and it's like the moment you drag yourself off the floor in those moments because you have to continue with your life. Then he just goes and calls the next song 'Follow Your Dreams'! I mean, come on.",
        "There's also the most incredible guitar sound in 'Stay By My Side' which at first was off-putting but now I'm spellbound by it. It gives the song this gravity, as if he's talking about the real serious shit this time. The final track is super similar to 'The Final Frame' and I love it for that. God I love this album so much.

It feels wrong to not listen to this front to back, because all the tracks fit in with each other so well. It has an abstract concept running through it as well of a girl who decides to get a special disk inserted into her brain, featuring multiple characters. It's very conceptual and each time you listen to the album you understand a bit more of it. The album has a bunch of amazing moments, especially when it gets LOUD! And the team really exhibit some amazing chord progressions (my weakness) and different vibes. The interlude near the start sounds like Wii Sports, 'Cry For Me' sounds like Dancing Queen and 'Angel on a Satellite' sounds like Debussy. This album was the one I listened to most in 2024!"

The world didn't know what hit them when she release 'Smooth Operator' back then. This music is SO classy, it's music for smoking, making deals, and most of all, making babies. It's silky, it's smooth, it makes you want to stretch and relax, and lock eyes with the high-flying 5-o'clock shadow businessman at the other end of the bar. Just LOOK at her on the album cover, I mean come on. She is singing about the diamond life, but also the tough life. My favourite on this album is the final track, which is a cover of Timmy Thomas's civil rights song. Interesting factoid about the original, its hypnotic drum loop was used for Drake's 'Hotline Bling' (his only good song). I love how Sade's version also has a long, slow intro just like the original"

One track in particular has had a major effect on me in 2024, 'I Never Thought I'd See the Day'. It's a very quiet track with just two bass notes keeping the rhythm while Sade sings about the day it all goes wrong, and it's perfect for when you want to wallow in your sadness, or you are contemplating life-changing things.

        "To think that we get the honour of living in a world where Sade graces us with their magnus opus, their ultimate album, the unbeatable Love Deluxe. This album REEKS of sensuality, desire and classy confidence. I went and put every track in the top tracks because it's just one of those albums. It starts off with the best one, 'No Ordinary Love', the sexiest song ever, and one I regularly put on during sex. The main theme of Streets of Rage, a house-influence soundtrack, reminds me of this song which makes me love it more. Then there's just always this amazing beat and vibe, more so than the previous albums, it's almost hypnotic. Hard to put into words. 'Like a Tattoo' has this devastating story, and when she sings 'I still feel the chill as I reveal my shame to you' I always have to stop what I'm doing and take a moment. And it ends with another beautiful instruments. God it's just a perfect album"

They clearly have impeccable senses of humour which was on display when I heard 'Holiday' for the first time. A super serious opening, atmospheric, epic, then her vocals come in and it ALMOST feels like she's taking the piss. They have amazing music videos, my favourite of which is 'Luvin U Is Easy' which is just them having so much fun, and the song is such amazing classic house. Also, the song 'Break It Bought It' is definitely my drag song, and I will DJ it at my birthday party"

My favourite track is the first one because it channels Kylie Minogue so good, but I also love the dirty synth chords in 'Sicko' even if I do find the dude a little much. She, meanwhile, is the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen, and that is mostly seen in the Sicko video. They also bring back that classic house party experience on 'Real Move Touch' which I adore"

This isn't her famous album but it's the one I like the most because she put in a ton of Portuguese and Brazilian influences into it. Some of the slower tracks are so fucking melodramatic, I love it. There are some nice upbeat tracks too but nobody does romantic crooning heartbreak songs like her. 'So We Meet Again My Heartache' is so extra. And I love the most the song 'Se Voce Me Ama', it makes me want to dim the lights, smoke a cigarette, display my body and confront my troubled lover about my heartbreak"

That's the stunning highlight of the album but the other songs are also great. This album is undoubtedly a bit doomer, which I heavily vibe with.

Then it's just banger after banger. 'Kong' is insanely good I mean what a track. Then Andreya Triana comes on and Bonobo just has amazing taste in vocalists because I love her. 'Eyesdown' is such a strong vibe. Then it gets wild with the next couple of tracks. In the fact the whole album is wild. Completely full of fascinating and interesting songs.

Bonobo is really good at picking all the right instruments, especially when it comes to percussion and you can really hear that here. I also love the amount of strong saxophone we are treated to.

She really leans into the Vogue/walking the catwalk angle of the genre and what can I say, she smashes it.

        "Deeply personal album! This is a local band from where I'm from and whenever I listen to this I'm transported back to sixth form. One of the songs 'Fuel Up' is about being in a car at various stages in your life. It felt very salient because at that time I had just learned to drive myself. Little did I know I would grow up to become a car hater! The song still makes me emotional though. Then there's 'We Are the Battery Human' which is so good! It's about staring at screens too much, a topic very dear to my heart. I will always fondly remember seeing them live in Oxford with my childhood friend Oscar. It felt like a big moment before we both left for university"

Sometimes when I doom about the world too hard I put this on. When I feel like shit and I want to feel worse, then I put this on. Why? It's definitely the wildest album on this webpage. Give the first track a listen and you'll see why. If you make it to the second track, you'll already have stopped what you're doing to give it your full attention. It just escalates from there.",

Kristen Hayter plays multiple characters who use religion to shield their vices and excuse their bare-faced threats and prejudices. There are also moments of peace on the track, but even they expose the deep sadness and loneliness behind these characters and asks the question of whether this is what makes bad people do bad things.",

At first glance it's plain singer songwriter acoustic stuff, but if you get into it you find some of the most gorgeous songs. I use this album to relax and reflect. This album is for pensively staring out the window. I especially love 'Armour' because it's about the feeling of powerlessness in a relationship when the other person doesn't want to help themselves. Also 'Gillian' because it's so heartwarming. It's about feeling better after hearing Gillian Welch sing. The songs are kind of melancholic but actually there is a ton of positivity here too and I love that. It's like sad songs about happy things"

It's very maximalist, lots of shit going on constantly. It's very jazzy which is fun, lots of cluster chords and off-beat syncopated rhythms and time signatures and stuff. The singer is ad-libbing a lot and knows all the harmonies super good. My first song of theirs 'Breathing Underwater' which is a good showcase for their wild music.

It also helped that this is a legendary album with so much smart shit going on. Many layers and an over-arching story. It's even got this insane poem which is slowly recites as the album progresses, each line of the poem causing a flashback-like switch into another song, ultimately building up this picture of Kendrick as a successful rapper finding himself abusing his position, coming back to Compton and despairing at the state of affairs. I love so many great moments in this album. Everything about 'For Free?', the beat in 'King Kunta', the chord progression in 'How Much A Dollar Cost', Rapsody's verse in 'Complexion', the fight that breaks out in 'i', and most of all I love the song 'These Walls'.

Cold as in, not warm and fuzzy love songs, but rather pointy, jaggedy, I guess Icelandic. The lyrics are warm but the strings sound like a fresh breeze that makes you want to curl up under the sheets. Then this album also has some great dance music. Love it so much"

I listened and loved Debut when I was younger but she has a whole bunch of other great albums too, including this one.

        "This album means so much to me because I listened to it so much when visiting Mexico! It really helped me sink into Mexican culture and was my gateway drug to the huge world of Mexican music. She was already legend in Mexico but this album takes things to the next level. It's stunning. It merges lots of styles of music from all over latin america, is a little jazzy, and takes its time with long intros and lovely instrumentals. It still respects your time though. From beginning to end it takes your hand and guides you through all these emotional topics and I just love it so much. I also learned more about this album as I learned spanish, which was awesome. My favourites are the upbeat ones like 'El lugar correcto' and 'Canta la arena', and the very last track I have to save for special occasions because it makes me so sad"

You can put on this album in your headphones when the wind is blowing really hard. Actually that makes a lot of sense because a bunch of the songs are about wind and storms and stuff. My favourite song is 'Bye Bye Bye' which feels like a tsunami. Tragically one of the band members died and they haven't made music since"

One thing's for sure, I spent ages practicing this to myself at home before going to Monster Ronson's karaoke for the fun time. That key change is hard if you're new to singing like me. I am convinced that that song is actually very dark, it's about staying in an abusive relationship because it's too scary to leave it. There's this shot of her running in the music video with a look on her face which convinces me that I'm right.",

This early 90s production by Stock Aitken Waterman is so good and Kylie fucking smashes it on all these songs. I am obsessed with the minute and a half intro to 'Shocked' I mean what a build up! And then there is the hilarious 'One Boy Girl' which features an uncredited rap from The Poetess, about her being faithful to her man, even when all the other girls are sleeping round. It's really great, definitely a bit problematic but I just love it"

        "I love this album so much. I also only ever play it on special occasions, when I'm feeling particularly emotional. The first thing you should know about the album though is that it's a doomer album. She is explicitly talking about the climate crisis, and how the world is on the verge of collapse. She sings about how trans people are scapegoated for all the world's problems. In the video of 'It Must Change', Mother Earth is played by a black trans woman as she issues a warning. 'Why Am I Alive Now?' is just openly specific about the fading of the natural world, and also the most beautiful song she's ever made. Those electric guitar chords... the moment when the chords cycle through and she sings 'birds and insects looking for a place to hide'... and the music video about trans women finding each other... it's just so stunning. Whenever I listen to this I am reminded of see her live in Berlin. The soundscape she created was breathtaking. I wish all the best for her"

I'm not really sure but definitely a lot of wind instruments like the oboe, which just makes for a whole new sound. And it's like that the whole album through, with tons of fun musical ideas and wild songs about all sorts of topics.",

I was deep in my singer songwriter phase and found a lot of meaning in a lot of these songs. My first Feist track ever was actually 'Inside and Out' for some reason. I still love it! 'Gatekeeper' is so nice. It's about some person or thing who is stopping summer from arriving, and realising that certain relationships don't work in the other seasons of the year. Then you've got 'Leisure Suite' which is a classy Sade-like track about being comfortable at home. 'Secret Heart' I always thought was about coming out as gay but then I read the lyrics and also realised it's a cover of Ron Sexsmith and I realised it's actually just about a man saying I love you to a woman. Whatever art isn't meant to be interpreted by the artist anyway, I, the listener, decide what it's about for me"

'It's the dirtiest clean I know', 'Take it slow, take it easy on me', 'My moon's white face'... whatever. This album is great. It's a collection of some of the all time best Feist songs. I love 'The Park' so much because we've all fucking been there. You're in a park or something and you just imagine someone you know being there too by chance. This album also features 'The Limit To Your Love' the original track that James Black famously interpolated. I love this track sooooo much, especially those piano chords in the chorus. So dramatic.

Back when I was friends with a bunch of people on the internet as a teenager, I was recommended this band and this album had just come out. It was so unlike anything I was listening to at the time (indie music only) but I totally vibed with it. It's so intense and so thick. So busy. The first song I really vibed with was 'Summertime Clothes' but I realise that every track on this thing has something special about it. The incredible admission of 'Are you also frightened?' at the end of that song, insane. Just like the end of 'Brother Sport'. It's actually nuts. Actually that last song sounds like how nutting feels. I also adore the time signature of 'Lion in a Coma' and the beautiful chill track 'No More Runnin'. I'm embarrassed to admit it but I associate this album memory-wise with playing World of Warcraft"

        "This album's lyrics are so wild that you straight up can't put this on while other people are around. It's like toxic masculinity, the album, all about the kind of weak-ego men who visit prostitutes and treat women like shit, and the lyrics explicitly address that. Have a listen to 'Holy, Holy' and if you're too shocked to continue, you can stop there. It's definitely more than just the painting of this picture though, the descriptions of these men also reveal their vulnerabilities as well. Like after 5 minutes of horrible self-aggrandising speech to a new prostitute at his favourite brothel, in the climax he reveals that he'll just pay her to go to the bathroom with him and put her hand on his knee, and not actually touch her. The albums actually about how society drives men to such extremes and reveals how much they are suffering as a result too.",

One thing that I especially love about it is the use of brazilian samba rhythms, especially in the song 'Terra'. And I also love the final part of 'As If Waltz' with the guitar solo. So good"

There is a really good run of tracks in the second half which cover a range of vibes.

Eye in the Wall for its major chords over the almost eerie backing track, and Photograph for its hard hitting lyrics and emotional moments."

        "These are actually two EPs that I spent my life assuming was one album because that's how I had it saved on my mp3 player. They're a swedish electronic duo and their vibe is particularly special. The music conjures the image of taking a plan to travel to farther shores. The album feels like the soundtrack to a fast paced life-before-your-eyes montage. The combination of marimbas, distant trumpets, whistling, makes this whimsical, tropical feeling, almost like the feeling you get when you take molly. Then when 'Introduction' specifically gives those travelling business class vibes (seriously how did I not know it was two EPs when track 7 was called 'Introduction'), then it crashes into the insane 'Karibien' which is ultra intense, it's like the part at the start when you're REALLY high. When the vocals say 'emergency, sur le dessin bleu' I get shivers. Great album. Albums"

It's got this fun mix of hip hop, rock, pop and I guess like film music for westerns (just listen to the start of the song 'Plastic Beach'). One thing Gorillaz does really well are features, the two Little Dragon songs are both so good, and I love Bobby Womack going ham on 'Stylo'.

I had a moment of betrayal when I mega-connected with the song 'Incapable' because I, too, might be incapable of love, and then read that in an interview she said she was playing a character, imagining what it would be like to not fall in love with everyone all the time, which is actually what happens.

She was learning in real time and every time she learned something, she posted this wild take about any given topic on twitter and people went crazy. I learned a lot about politics, specifically about white supremacy and colonialism from her twitter account alone! She eventually stopped because she got too much shit for being loud on twitter and mental health always comes knocking when you're a difficult celebrity. But I was always sympathetic to her, and I feel like the 'scandals' that she was involved in were all fine. She famously pulled out of Coachella because she didn't want to perform for white audiences and honestly I get it. It's a bad move for your career to piss off white people but it's a great move if you love performing for predominantly black people and you have other things to do with your life than commercialise your music"

Music that goes really well with winter. Take a listen to the first track 'Replicate' and you'll see what I mean. It's still nice, and still positive and optimistic music! It's just cool and wintry.

        "Shoutouts to Ginger Root for recreating the vibe of Japanese 80's city pop and smashing it with these camp, funny tracks. I've been a fan since Loretta. This site is for recommending the music but I have to tell you, dear reader, to watch some of their music videos, they are so good. The videos from this album all follow a wild story and are just a ton of fun. I also really like the music too, even though it's kinda wild to hear English lyrics. This album was one of those albums where I got really obsessed with the singles as they released, then when I finally listened to the album I realised that the teaser singles were already most of the 35 minute run time! Still, I love these tracks"

        "This is a legendary and classic album, unlike anything else and 100% worth your time. It's got its roots in sample-based hip-hop beats, but it goes so crazy on the samples, in fact the whole thing consists of samples, to the point where it's this insane mess of sounds all thrown together. And it sounds great. They became famous for 'Frontier Psychiatrist' which is classic and a banger, and hilarious. 'That boy needs therapy' being the basis of the chorus is just great. They have so many great moments like this thanks to their choice of samples. I love on 'Little Journey' when the woman says 'So I'll say... bon voyage!' right before a big splash and this dramatic music as if she is walking off into the sunset and the credits start rolling. Right after that is 'Live at Dominoes' which might be THE beach party track of the century. And I love how the final track also samples the same string sample that Jens Lekman uses all over his first album. But I have to give special shout-outs to the best song, 'Since I Left You' which is the definition of a summer anthem. It's so good, so sunny, like a montage of someone's crazy travels in paradise"

        "This album is huge and amazing. A perfect album for driving in your car, especially if it's a long trip. Great for singing along to with friends and generally vibing. I get that their previous album is their classic but this is my favourite for sure, I think because it's more poppy and accessible. Their signature sample-heavy music is still on full display here though. I love the addicting string loop in 'Subways' which bleeds into 'Going Home' as well but in a different way. The cute little samples like 'Isn't he great? Far out!', or 'I'm in my treehouse with my cup of coffee' are just so delightful. It's got its fair share of silliness, similar to Gorillaz Plastic Beach, psychedelic stuff too. I love love love the song 'Harmony', it sounds like someone making fun of angels descending to earth. I like the absolute drama of 'The Wozard Of Iz', the chorus of 'Sunshine' which makes you feel like you're going crazy. There's just a lot to enjoy and if you listen to it enough times you'll find some kind of story-like thread running through the whole thing"

The song titles are wild but despite that the lyrics are largely sane and the music is beautiful. Songs unlike anything else I've heard like 'A River Don't Stop To Breathe' or the incredible 'Illuminated' go through these amazing cycles of chords and it's just so hypnotic.

That being said, they did release a bunch of EPs which I really enjoy, this one most of all.

I can't really imagine how or why it happened but now I know all the Beach Boys songs! I didn't realise it back then because I was a child but I always gravitated towards the tracks they released later on in their discography. Having learned more about the band as an adult, I now get it. Towards the end of the 60s, they abandoned the surfer rock they're known for and went far more experimental. These albums didn't sell well but they are the ones with all my favourite tracks! I barely listened to full albums from them but this one I did get into in the end, because it has some of my all time faves. 'Surf's Up' is great, although don't try to read into the lyrics, they are very bewildering. 'Disney Girls' also has a special place in my heart for some reason. I love the whistling in it"

Picture the scene, it's Horse Meat Disco and you're freaking out with all the gay dudes and Kitty and then 5 drag queens take the stage and go off to 'Free Yourself' by Jessie Ware. The room explodes because it's the queer hit of the summer and the perfect blend of disco and pop. Since that moment I have DJ'd this track maybe 5 times. It's just a very important track! And the album surrounding it is of course fantastic. I think in 2023 it was my number 1 on spotify. The opening track is also so great and so fun. A special Fraser Favourite is definitely 'Begin Again' which has this amazing feeling, I would describe it as 'desperate disco', like it's dramatic, about a serious topic, but also disco music. Crying while dancing kinda music. Also want to shout out the slower tracks 'Hello Love' and 'These Lips' which are so lovely"

He does it because he's fucking woke and yes, we've known that the world was going to go to shit since the 60s. Police brutality and racism of course are also playing a part in 'what's going on' and he lays it all out on the table. It almost hurts to listen to his song 'Save The Children' knowing what we do about the world today. Sorry Marvin, the kids are fucked. One other thing about this album, the songs blend into each other so well, the whole way through the album, so why didn't he do the same for the first two tracks??"

        "I just blew myself away by looking up this guy and it turns out he's English! I always assumed he was American because of the country vibe in the album. But no he's from close to where I'm from which I guess explains why I know about him in the first place. This album is giving Nick Drake. It's folky and I would describe it as colourful. Lots of lovely strings in there as well. I especially love the calm songs on this album, but I'm impressed how he can do the dream-like festival tracks ('Passing Stranger', 'Dream Song') so well as well. And 'The Fool's Fooling Himself' is so intense and good. It's like when the Tallest Man on the Earth did 'Where do my bluebird fly?' and younger me was shook that the artist would present an angry song."

        "As a fan of Grizzly Bear and also Department of Eagles, of course I'll be keeping an eye on Daniel Rossen's solo projects. He is a visionary and I am a fan. His newer album is also great, but this little EP he released really stuck with me, in particular the song 'Saint Nothing', which was recommended by the singer from the Leisure Society. I learned how to play it on the piano and everything. All the songs are great though. The music with all the stringed instruments and banjos feels like the tingling you get from pins and needles, or drugs"

It's kinda indie rock which I wouldn't immediately recommend to friends because maybe it's a bit generic, but I personally really enjoy these tracks. 'Excuses' is a fun and dramatic lying in the grass track, 'Cold War' was a great track for going jogging. There's a lot to enjoy here!"

        "Alright just so it's clear I think these days that Muse is dogshit but picture young Fraser in year 7 whose brothers told him to listen to 'real music' (I was listening to Kylie at the time). At first it was so horrible and heavy! But I totally got into Muse. Listening to this album again now transported me back to my childhood years playing Runescape. Young Fraser was a cocky bastard who thought he was the bees knees, especially when it came to playing the piano, and so I was pleased to find that fans of 'real music' were enjoying the heavy use of piano in this album. When I learned to play this solo in 'Butterflies & Hurricanes' I thought it would be the key to popularity at school! Turns out when you're a child, you're delusional. I was at least. Anyway I kinda hate this band now but I'm totally rocking out to the album as I write this so fuck it, it's good. Origin of Symmetry and Showbiz too, fuck it."

This is the first album and it's a bit weird and idiosyncratic but I think it's kinda neat. I especially love 'Average Fruit' where she lusts after this guy.

When the penny dropped I was blown away. To think I liked the album in its shit pirated form like that already says a lot though. Massive Attack have a bunch of great tracks, but this album is my favourite because so much of it is so memorable, while still being classic deep vibes from the band. It's like music for swamp creatures. Special shoutout to 'Psyche' which creeped me out. I remember listening to that track while revising for exams in my year in Switzerland"
