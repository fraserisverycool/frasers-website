Yoshis and the Wind is so good, I even covered this once on piano with my friend Amy on cello. Sure a lot of the music is a variation of the main theme, but the final credits theme 'Yoshi's Tale' isn't, it's a beautiful and different melody that has been an all-time favourite VGM for me since I was child.

Otherwise we have all the town themes but this time split into night and day - so thoughtful! We can listen to the combined versions on the BOTW soundtrack... that's how you know that the devs of this app care. We also have a new town: Lookout Landing. I love it so much!

The music featuring the legendary pokemon has this weird wolf whistle melody which I feel like is almost right, but in the end just sounds weird and uncomfortable. There are two notable exceptions, the battle music for the Battle Tower, which you can actually hear is composed by Toby Fox of Undertale fame. It really stands out compared to all the others! But most importantly of all, this game introduced the most incredible Gym Leader music, arguably one of the best in the whole series. When you're in the stadium and this techno-inspired music starts blasting, it's so fucking good. It goes so hard.
