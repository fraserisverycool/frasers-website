I got hooked on this album after watching her amazing Tiny Desk concert where she plays the 10 minute break up song 'Green Eyes', the closer of this album. When she says 'I don't know why I fucked with you' that's the final nail in the coffin, she has finally moved on. I also love love love the track 'Orange Moon' and intend to sing it to any and all future lovers. And also the chill bit at the end of 'Time's a wastin', and the amazing remix of her hit 'On & On' called '...& On'",

They clearly have impeccable senses of humour which was on display when I heard 'Holiday' for the first time. A super serious opening, atmospheric, epic, then her vocals come in and it ALMOST feels like she's taking the piss. They have amazing music videos, my favourite of which is 'Luvin U Is Easy' which is just them having so much fun, and the song is such amazing classic house. Also, the song 'Break It Bought It' is definitely my drag song, and I will DJ it at my birthday party",

Having loved the previous album, I was so pumped when this came out and it totally delivered! My favourite track is the first one because it channels Kylie Minogue so good, but I also love the dirty synth chords in 'Sicko' even if I do find the dude a little much. She, meanwhile, is the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen, and that is mostly seen in the Sicko video. They also bring back that classic house party experience on 'Real Move Touch' which I adore",

The rest of the album has such a great summer party vibe, but also with an element of fantasy. I especially love the closing track, and looking it up now, I realise it features Alan Palomo from the band Neon Indian, which adds up. I did have a listen to their new album but it really doesn't hit the same. They peaked with their first album",

I love most the warm synths in the second verse of 'Youre' gonna make me lonesome', it just feels me with warmth. Otherwise the album is great for gazing out of the window, smoking, feeling pensive, or wondering if you should text him. Special shoutouts to her other album 'Bare Bones' which I also really like",

They played two songs from this album at their concert, Eye in the Wall and Photograph, two songs that I utterly adore.

They're a swedish electronic duo and their vibe is particularly special. The music conjures the image of taking a plan to travel to farther shores. The album feels like the soundtrack to a fast paced life-before-your-eyes montage. The combination of marimbas, distant trumpets, whistling, makes this whimsical, tropical feeling, almost like the feeling you get when you take molly. Then when 'Introduction' specifically gives those travelling business class vibes (seriously how did I not know it was two EPs when track 7 was called 'Introduction'), then it crashes into the insane 'Karibien' which is ultra intense, it's like the part at the start when you're REALLY high.

I remember watching the music for 'God put a smile upon your face' and being genuinely touched by it. Watching it now as I write this, apart from being put off by them trying to make Chris Martin look hot, it's still good! And the song itself is so good, actually the best Coldplay song. And the album just has a bunch of other great tracks which take me back to that time. I also particularly love the closing track because it's genuinely beautiful, and if you spend any time on this website, you'll quickly learn that I love sad songs. When I found out that my ex-boyfriend Ichsan loved Coldplay I was initially nervous (if you're reading this Ichsan I'm sorry for giving you shit for liking this band), but actually it was really nice bonding about old songs like this.",

It's got some cheesy tracks but you gotta embrace them. Great to put on at a party at home with cool people. Free Xone is an actual bop, like a real actual Bop.",
