      "description": "I love Erykah Badu, she is everything. I got hooked on this album after watching her amazing Tiny Desk concert where she plays the 10 minute break up song 'Green Eyes', the closer of this album. When she says 'I don't know why I fucked with you' that's the final nail in the coffin, she has finally moved on. I also love love love the track 'Orange Moon'. And also the chill bit at the end of 'Time's a wastin', and the amazing remix of her hit 'On & On' called '...& On'"
