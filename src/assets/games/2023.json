        "There are so many fun ideas and fun levels, and it really makes you want to play the game well. You can't die in the levels, but you WANT a good score. Going back and redoing levels for a higher score is a lot of fun. The game is based off of Wario Land 4, which happens to be one of my favourite games from my childhood. They took that concept and fucking ran with it. This spiritual successor surpasses the classic!"

        "This game blew me away. Very hard to describe what it's about but here we go. You start the game inside an egg and you have to be born, but not before you get some kind of seed implanted inside of you. You are tasked by what appears to be a religious entity (the Centre) to rid the world of dust and bring about the Anodyne, something like a rapture (the word “anodyne” means painkiller). As you go around removing the evil dust, the seed inside you watches as you do your job. The evil dust affects the citizens of the weird and wonderful world, and you remove it, numbing the pain and “clarifying” things for them.",
        "As you go through the game, doing your job and meeting all these suffering people, you realise the game relates a lot to the human experience. There are many points in the game where you can draw parallels to how we grow up, how our parents affect us, our relationship with entities like “the Centre”, and many many other things. The game is dripping with meaning.",
        "It also has an immaculate vibe. The world looks like a PS1 game, polygons and everything, but it also has nice lighting. The colour palette makes it look dreamy. It also looks dumb and trashy and low budget and I love that. There are also some 2D sections for when you shrink down to a miniscule size in order to clean the dust, and they are delightful. If you're interested, give <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SnkLnlsnY\">this track from an opening area</a> a listen"

      "review": [
        "I love Pikmin with my whole heart. There's something special about it. The combination of the focus on nature, the soundtrack, the wacky characters, and the kinda dark elements combine to give it a certain X factor which is hard to pin down with words. When I think about whether games are good, they can get approval from me for a variety of reasons. Like Slay the spire is just great gameplay. But most of my favourite games just have great vibes.",
        "The vibe of pikmin is so fucking strong that it's insane, and the gameplay is good enough that it's fun to spend time in the game soaking up the vibe. The first pikmin arguably had the worst gameplay but the strongest vibe. The time limit, as well as harshness of the environment, and some highlights like the first encounters with specific bosses. Lots of bullshit with pikmin killing themselves, general difficulty. It is a great time and might be my favourite pikmin.",
        "The second pikmin game is a lot bigger and also has vibes in spades. The areas are super nice, music is fantastic (I love the piklopedia), and gameplay significantly improved with having two captains. The caves seemed pretty random though - like time stops when you're down there and then you've just got this ability to go back to the previous floor if you lose too many pikmin. I feel like it takes away from the general feeling of the game, and it's more like bonus content.",
        "Pikmin 3 is super interesting. It's fucking gorgeous, has beautiful areas and possibly the best music of all. It also does away with the caves, and instead just has a really big overworld, which brings back that pikmin 1 vibe a lot. I never liked how the treasures were just fruits though, that seemed pointless. It also added mission mode, which was the best thing ever in terms of gameplay - these super fun little challenge modes. The final boss was also very special.",
        "Now after 10 years we finally get Pikmin 4 and I have been excited for it, even more so than for Zelda. In terms of gameplay, everything is there. Quality of life changes to the max, meaning that pikmin actually do what they're told, all the pikmin content you could wish for. All the old bosses coming back, caves, hours of gameplay. I had a fun time collecting all the treasures and completing everything.",
        "But something's off. The game feels like a huge collection of content being thrown in. More is more! The caves are more content, the dandori challenges (like pikmin 3 mission mode) are great but integrated into the game like extra content. They brought back the (terrifying in pikmin 2) waterwraith and it felt empty. It just dropped two of them in the final dungeon. Doing that really takes away the special vibe of that particular boss. I realised that in pikmin 4, vibe was sacrificed for more content, and that this is true for many games these days.",
        "The quality of life changes &amp; powered up rewind function makes it so it's very easy to get through the game without losing pikmin, so stakes are way lower now. I think I miss the chaos of the first two pikmins where one misstep can cause your whole squad to get flattened without warning. Electricity immediately killing them, the gatling groinks, yellows throwing bombs back at you. There's something delicious about that.",
        "On top of that, the music isn't so great. The Olimar sidequest tracks are great, but otherwise it's gone a different direction: now it has ultra adaptive music (something the series is famous for and a big contributor to the X factor) but it's so adaptive to the point it's barely recognisable. There are multiple layers which fade in and out depending on what enemy you're fighting, what you're carrying etc. Nothing you can hum.",
        "They also retconned the lore, and it was \"all a dream\" or something. They had Louie be the bad guy but then cleared things up after, and there were no open questions left like in Pikmin 2. There was no weird shit like the Pikmin 3 final boss. And final complaint: I wish they integrated the night time/glow pikmin sections better.",
        "But to end on a positive, I really loved getting platinum medals in the dandori challenges, and those final ones were tough as nails. I still loved this game. I even painted a picture of Oatchi for my living room!"

        "Playing this game felt a lot like playing Breath of the Wild back in 2017, although it has to be said: nothing can truly recreate that feeling of magic we all felt back then. It's undeniably a better game, but some of that magic is gone the second time around. It's super interesting because it's forcing me to reflect on why I enjoyed playing BotW more, despite it being emptier and more annoying. How we enjoy games really depends on so many things, not just the game itself. In this case, it was because there really wasn't anything like it before.",
        "Anyway here we are in 2023 playing Zelda again and it's a lot of fun. The new abilities are nice. I was actually in it for the new content, music, areas and surprises though. There was a lot to enjoy, but it really does rely on existing content a bit too much. I wish exploring Hyrule wasn't so similar to how it was before.",
        "I really loved some of the new stuff though. The new temples, great! Especially that gorgeous Lightning Temple music, hell yes. Getting from A to B using a ratchet flying machine, great.

It's genuinely a pleasure to build decks and fight with them, and it's hard to describe why.",

As we progressed through, the game assaulted us with more and more vaginal imagery. Lots of imagery surrounding childbirth, wombs, balls shooting through tubes, phalluses. The real deal. I couldn't not see it.",
        "The puzzles got really good towards the end. I love a good puzzle game and this one blew my mind. It was so clean and polished as well. At many points in the game we nodded and said “...game design”. This had clearly been designed by a real game designer yknow. Actually I wondered if it was a little too over-engineered, taking away the magic a bit. But I couldn't deny that the little game design things they implemented were all great. Things like old paths closing off if it's definitely the wrong way to go, or pleasant music playing when you start solving a puzzle in the right way."

The story is about war and normal fire emblem stuff, but then the characters are just so ridiculous. Every chapter there is a new ridiculously dressed person who joins your party and you just have to take it as it is. It's actually really funny and entertaining because of that.",

This time for the first time I played on casual mode (as opposed to classic mode, where you have permadeath) and it GREATLY improved my gameplay experience. I didn't have to reset when someone got hit with a critical hit! I should have used this option the whole time. To balance it out, I also played on hard mode, which made the game more fun, although I was resentful that my playtime extended very long because of it. Also a little bit of me is unsatisfied because I switched it to normal difficulty for the final boss... I just ran out of patience.",

        "One thing I look for the most in games is a good vibe, which is often from a combination of characters, environments, colour palettes, art, dialogue and most importantly, music. Sea of stars has just such a great vibe. I really enjoy the character designs and the environments and the lighting especially. There's an ability that lets you change the time of day and it looks soooo good, I've never seen anything like it.",

        "There's a few gameplay elements which make it not the best game ever. The battle system is a lot of fun, especially with the timed inputs and breaking of opponent's big moves, and I never groaned when I had a battle. However it doesn't have too much depth. It takes a long time before the characters learn any new attacks and when they do, they're never gamechanging. In fact I spent all the game using moonerang because it's simply the strongest attack. On top of that, one of the moves 'disorient' can really be abused to stop bosses ever doing their strong attack, which resulted in me missing all exciting animations from the final boss, which was a bit lame.",
        "Next part has some light story spoilers...",
        "The worst thing about this game though, is that the two main characters are plain and boring. They have no personality, they just go around winning battles and solving problems like boring heroes. How did they survive 10 years of isolation and training and then become perfectly well rounded heroes? The previous solstice warriors ended up not being well-rounded at all. The other characters are also pretty plain, with the exception of Resh'an, which was a genuine pleasant surprise. I appreciate that there was little dialogue, because it gave off those old fashioned SNES vibes, but it did mean that there was little to no character development. It's a shame because I like the designs.",
        "When it comes to world building, I have a couple of questions. If we're dealing with multiple timelines and universes, why are we just focusing on two of them? How did we end up consistently going between these two specifically using the vast sea of stars? Considering the name of the game is sea of stars, the whole concept isn't very well explored. I mean we got this insane, super cool warp sequence there, but even though we traverse the sea multiple times, we never see that again.",
        "One thing about the lore which I did enjoy were the stories told by Teaks. They're perfect fantasy fairytales which work really well with the minimal dialogue, set to nice music and revealed at points in the story when you haven't figured it out yourself yet.",
        "In conclusion, this is a game which does have that X factor which is so rare in the wealth of video games we are bombarded with these days, but it has some things holding it back from being one of my favourites. I did push through all 30 hours though, which says something"

        "One of my goals is to play, complete and understand all the games that the smash characters are from. I did play Banjo Kazooie as a child but I'm pretty sure I never completed it, so having recently got the Nintendo switch online expansion pass, I decided it was time to replay it!",
        "Now in terms of vibes this game is off the charts. There is so much fun nonsense to enjoy. Absolute highlight for me is Brentilda, Gruntilda's “nice” sister who is SUCH a bitch. She is just all over the map and all she does is hate on Gruntilda. It is so funny and I love the energy. Sometimes she's hiding in a corner somewhere and just pops up to say that Gruntilda is disgusting because she eats maggots for breakfast. Sets me off everytime.",
        "I have to say though. It's a terrible game, it's aged really badly. Collecting stuff isn't actually that fun. Having to collect all the music notes from the start whenever you die is miserable, and the jiggies are not signposted properly. The music is really good though, but of course I would say that as a lover of Donkey Kong 64 (proven to be a terrible game).",
        "I loved the final boss, because it was just a quiz. And Grunty is just so funny. Although, it turns out there's a difficult actual boss battle with her if you collect almost all the collectables. I just noped out of that one and watched it on youtube in the name of self-care."

        "Continuing the theme of playing games of smash characters, it was time to revisit the Dr Mario puzzle games and see what makes this game tick. As a big fan of Puyo Puyo Tetris (the best puzzle game ever) I was interested to see if this game had the same depth. Short answer: it doesn't. You have to get lucky with the pills, because there isn't a good strategy for what to do when you get the wrong pills. You have to constantly go for vertical rows of 4 because the horizontal ones are just so risky.",
        "I don't know if it's like this in other Dr Mario games but on this one you play against an opponent and they send single blocks over and it just fucks with everything. If they fall down at the wrong time, you're fucked and you have to restart, simple as that.",
        "I managed to get through the story mode by getting lucky, waiting for my opponent to fail or occasionally clutching it out with some good gameplay. I did end up getting quite good at it because it is really fast paced. The final battle was really hard though, you needed that combo of good RNG and good execution. I did kinda enjoy getting that W in the end I won't lie. Anyway this game isn't good but I kinda enjoyed playing it on my switch over christmas."

        "This game is super dumb. My friend Fab lent me the physical game and for some weird reason I ended up completing it. I admit that swinging around town is kinda fun, and towards the end I got better at the game and it was kinda satisfying using all the special abilities. That being said, I played the game on easy because I had no time for dying over and over against some goons.",
        "Wild that this game has web slinging moments, watching a movie moments, and then they pad out the time with swinging fists at goons and even stealthing around (?). Luckily I didn't need to stealth much because I was playing on easy. But it all felt very forced when I was doing all these epic stunts and then bam I'm in a building and have to fight some dudes for a bit.",
        "But god the story is just so ridiculous. I mean it's classic superhero nonsense and it's why I don't have any time for superhero films. There's just so much ridiculousness, like these hunters. There's this dude with too much money who likes hunting, and he has hundreds (thousands?) of loyal cultists who came with him from Foreign Country to New York, all of them willing to die for the cause. All trained in martial arts? There's this character called Black Cat who randomly finds a magic portal. Like, just magic is a thing.",
        "Venom as a thing is fascinating to me. How is this eldritch-horror ooze thing so popular? Everything surrounding this storyline was super predictable.",
        "The worst offender for this game is the very generic soundtrack. Boring ass movie music with no character. They should have given this game an actual vibe like the into the spiderverse film. I also resented how everything just gets destroyed all the time. Spiderman and his escapades just end up destroying every environment they're in.",

But I just wasn't enjoying it. I guess it's not my humour. And in my 2 or so hours with the game, the battle system didn't click with me.",

The fact is, I'm not interested enough in history to get me through this slow-paced game. I gave up after the first major event happened and it became clear where the game was going."

        "It's at the bottom of this list because it's so bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. The moment the early 2000s vibe hit like a truck during the opening I knew I was in for a treat. The thought of this being the coolest game ever as a child is just so funny at every point in the game.",
        "I should have known what I was in for in the opening section on the island, where the most annoying music ever played in a very short loop and I had to do nonsense tasks for my friends. After that I was treated to a bewildering story and game with many difficulty spikes, many points where I had no idea where to go, and many times having to look up a walkthrough.",
        "The disney worlds, one of the most bewildering aspects of the game, are so tiny and bland it's funny. I was just amazed that they managed to secure the rights to all these characters and worlds. Although by the end, having had my standards set so low, I found myself forming opinions on them. Why does Neverland only take place on a boat? It was kinda cool that you can be a mermaid in Atlantica... and the music in Agrabah isn't too bad. Those gummi ship sections though, terrible.",
        "I never truly understood how to use all the items. I spent a lot of the time without any proper weapons, nerfing myself to the point where bosses were endless HP sponges. I just assumed that's how the game was meant to be. I guess I've been trained by modern games to be signposted stuff like that.",

        "It's an action game like the main one, except the attack you do depends on what your next card is. So in order to get good at the game you have to manage your cards, and also fight in a 3D arena like in the first game. All is well and good but then you meet some boss and it's impossible to get past. I personally struggled with this bitch Larxene (shown in pic) halfway through the game. She is such a bitch I hate her so much.",
        "It completely recycles all the assets from the first game and just tells another bewildering story. At this point I'm just letting it all wash over me. We are introduced to a bizarre shadowy organisation full of villains who all speak with an irritating sarcastic tone constantly. It's a wonder that any of these characters get anything done because they don't know how to communicate at all.",
        "At some point in the game I decided I was in too deep and committed to completing the whole thing. I was forced to look up tactics for how to cheese some of these bosses because towards the end those health bars end up being ridiculously big. Cheesing works to an extent, but I have to admit, I had to get kinda good at the game to beat the bosses... maybe it wasn't so bad.",
        "What was bad was realising that when I completed the game, there's a whole second playthrough with Riku with a new story and new battle mechanics. I had to play it. That shit was also bullshit, just like the main game, and there were fewer opportunities to cheese opponents. Still, I did it. Beating Ansem at the end was really hard but I did it. Mickey Mouse randomly appeared. Riku is caught being edgier than ever before. I can't get over how different this game is to Kingdom Hearts 1."

This is particularly wild because this story is part of the Kingdom Hearts lore and they put it in the collection so players can follow the story chronologically. Feels like super bad planning.",

It's genuinely all they ever do, their only activity. Despite this, the story continues to be baffling and bewildering. At this point I'm so far gone that I'm just letting the bizarre vibes of this entry in the series wash over me. Maybe Kingdom Hearts 2 will be a real game."
