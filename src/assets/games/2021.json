I was genuinely breathless, terrified. When I thought about the game while I was at work, I would get scared thinking about it! It took so much emotional strength to get through the Starlit Cove. After writing that sentence I went and looked at someone play through Starlit Cove and I got scared again!! It's a terrifying game!!"

After putting out the initial fire in your escape pod, you need to somehow survive on an underwater alien planet! It's so cool!",

You're lucky to start in a shallow area, with the land almost poking out of the water to form an island but not quite. After you explore the immediate area, you have to go to deeper waters and let me tell you, diving deeper is fucking terrifying! Never have I felt the true terrifying power of big open spaces, deep black water beneath you, losing sight of the light hitting the surface. It's fucking terrifying.",

You start the game by apologising after you crashed your police car. Luckily, an actual capable detective comes to be your partner, Kim Kitsuragi. He is such a babe and I would die for him.",

Like when you get asked about your politic views, you get absolutely lambasted for being a centrist, it's very eye-opening. The things you'll end up doing in this game are crazy. Somehow the game made me think giving drugs to a child would be a good idea.",
