        "Daaaaamn this game is so good! This is another one of those rare information games where you have to understand stuff about the lore and how things work in order to progress. I read somewhere people call them 'Metroidbrainias' which I thoroughly enjoy. Although this game is actually a roguelike! You go through a explore this mansion by drafting new rooms as you go. Each room is full of secrets about what's actually going on and it makes you want to learn everything about the game.",
        "At the time of writing this I found the 46th room and decided to call it a day because the scope of the game is terrifying. I had many amazing eureka moments throughout my playthrough but one of them was learning about a crazy chess puzzle, thanks to happening to have the device you need to light candles on me when I finally got the basement key and was able to go down the fountain to the special area at the back. When I saw that those notes I had made about chess pieces in different rooms were about to be used... wait I have to draft them ALL? On top of this, my mate Rodrigo revealed at this point that he had over 150 hours in the game. For my sanity and my safety, I have to say no to the chess puzzle. I'll probably just get another sanctum key anyway, and that puzzle where I have to learn about all the history in order to make those sigils, my GOD. I wrote like 20 pages of notes for this, and I would have needed a new book to solve that one.",
        "Anyway shout-outs to this game. So many highlights. I loved the logic puzzles, Alzara, the Aquarium puzzle, the computer system, the excitement of going to a brand new room. So much to enjoy!",
        "I highly recommend this puzzle game! Puzzle games are the best!"

I love the music of this area's dark world, and the story got me really hooked on the lore. There were some amazing moments with the main character. I finished the chapter with a bunch of ideas about this prophecy, and felt the magic of Deltarune begin to take shape.",

The amount of chaos on the screen is just great. And it comes with all these cool movement options. When I figured out that you can jump forwards on a rock, stop doing that and bounce of the rock, and then roll forwards and punch in the air to go a bit further, I started to do that to get to all sorts of faraway places. It was so awesome! And there are bananas and fossils everywhere. It never gets boring finding them!",
        "I was a little worried about the vibes of the levels when I first saw the game. It really didn't make sense that they were underground and there was so much sunlight, but that stuff straight up isn't important. You still get a bunch of fun, distinct levels to go through. Personal highlights are the ice layer with the gay zebras, the beach layer and the part where the lava falls down like rain.",

The music is still great, the new funny character is great, I like the artstyle of the TV stuff. There's a lot to enjoy! Toby Fox has a way with humour. The storyline with the throuple was a highlight for me. I look forward to looking for secrets in this game further down the line! ...or maybe just watching a youtube video about it later."

        "Incredible! They just went and made the best Mario Kart ever. Mario Kart 8 really perfected the formula so I was asking myself how they would top it. By making it open world and having you drive between tracks, it has completely changed the formula and breathed new life into the series. At first I was skeptical about only going around the tracks for one lap and spending two or more laps travelling to the next one, but actually that's what this game is all about: all the crazy shit they throw at you between the tracks. No longer can you get good at Mario Kart by just learning all the tracks because you'll never learn this entire world. Instead, you have to react to all the new twists and turns awaiting you in every race. It means this will be replayable for ages!",
        "I really love the VS mode where you can select literally any stage and go from anywhere to anywhere. There are infinite possibilities! The other mode, Knockout tour, is also great, especially when playing online. However how come I can't make my own knockout tours out of my favourite tracks? That would be my one main wish for the game. Then I love the open world free roam mode! You can just explore all these cool places and it's absolutely covered in references to old Mario Kart games, which I love to soak up.",
        "But the real crown jewel of this game is the SOUNDTRACK! Holy shit!!! Not only does this feature absolute banger music for the 30 or so official tracks they have (including awesome intro music as you approach the stage), but it also features of 200 tracks of remixes of old mario and mario kart songs!! Between tracks and especially in the free roam and even on the main menu, you can just hear all this music. It's amazing! We've got reimaginings and modernisations of old and forgotten tracks, favourites, and just well everything in between. The sheer volume is insane, and each one has been made with such love. Playing this game and just hearing something like the Mario Kart DS credits theme, or Bowser's Castle GBA, or many obscure tracks just sets me off. Playing this game with me is insufferable because I will stop the conversation to point out the name of the track and how much I love it.",
        "Also, the characters! I love playing as Cheep Cheep, Snowman, Piranha Plant... I mean what an honour. I love it. I think this is gonna be a huge game on this system and I can't wait to keep playing it over the next decade!"

The player has no choice but to keep firing at the enemies, easy when paying attention, but difficult when vibing with the music so hard that you get distracted.

I was a little disappointed to learn that this was a roguelike. These days roguelikes make me upset because I would get a really good run then feel like I could never reach those heights again. This game offers next to nothing in terms of 'roguelite' elements, i.e. things that will make future runs easier. Instead you just have to git gud. I kinda have gotten better, but the element of luck involved is kinda putting me off. I'm sticking with it because I want to know about the lore and what some of these secrets mean."

It's definitely not the kind of game I would willingly buy, although I do have an appreciation for the Wii-era Nintendo Mii vibe, and I did play Tomodachi Life back then on the DS.",
        "This game is totally fucked up and I cannot recommend it in good conscious. It's a turn based RPG, although there is little to no strategy, and all the characters fight on their own, not really requiring your input. Playing this game you quickly realise it's not about gameplay, it's about the relationships between all the Miis you create. They all have little personalities and are very sassy with one another, early animal crossing style. I have it say, it's funny as fuck. I can really imagine this being hilarious if you take mushrooms. The sheer amount of nonsense is just insane.",
        "I spent a ridiculous amount of time at the start of the game making a bunch of high quality Miis, and realised that there are so many NPCs in the game, and you can make Miis for them all. I just felt invested because these Miis were all so good, I couldn't just drop the game, even if there isn't really a game here. So I would progress, and every now and then, another one of my horrible creations would turn up and it would just be hilarious.",

Luckily, the horse that you befriend some ways into the game broke up the fight.",

        "This one is special because there is a whole world full of puzzles that you can walk around freely. If a puzzle is too difficult, you can just find something else to do and come back to it. This is great most of the time, but this game does have power ups which make certain puzzles possible, and sometimes when I'm tackling a tough puzzle I doubt myself whether I'm just too dumb to solve it, or if I actually need to collect a power-up from somewhere else first. It's led to a couple of moments of frustration, but it's totally forgivable given how good the puzzles are.",

I managed to beat the final puzzles and didn't really understand what was going on. But it's fine the game is about the puzzles after all.

So when I saw this sequel I was sceptical because it's just a plain old rhythm game. Nonetheless I like me a rhythm game and it's a been a while so I got it and it's so good. This might be the most polished rhythm game I've ever played.",
        "It's hard as nails, but also so reasonable! The timings are forgiving, and there's this system where you lose health if you get hit by an incoming monster, so if you don't press the right button in time. But if you press the wrong button at any given point, you don't lose health, instead you lose your combo. So it means that you can kind of mash on the difficult bits, and at first this bothered me, but it just means that you can get through the levels without dying, just with a low score. So you can kinda play the game how you want, going for the high score or not. Going for the high score is insanely difficult but those leaderboards are tempting me, that's for sure.",
        "When I accidentally started a song on hard mode near the start, I was so shook. You're meant to be able to follow all that?? But by the end of playing through the story, I got so good at the game. Things which seemed impossible like those jumping harpies, I've totally got down now. I just needed to practice them and the songs they come in. I've since gone through and beaten (almost) everything on hard mode and it feels great. It feels so good to get good at the game, and this game lets you do that. The progression through the track is pretty great for that.",
        "There are some other things like minigames and bosses, but they're nothing compared to the actual core gameplay, it's all about the normal rhythm game stuff. I will say there is a really cool thing in 'remix mode' which randomises the monsters, so you kinda have serious replayability. And the difficulty levels will keep you going for a long time.",
        "I will admit, in terms of vibes, there is another rhythm game which has this beat: Everhood. Everhood had an actually fascinating story, lots of funny and wacky nonsense and all around great vibes. This game is far more generic in terms of presentation, and the story is actually a joke. I would have loved some funny writing. But at least the music is good! I didn't love the heavy metal tracks because I'm just not a fan of the genre, but also because they tended to be too fast, making reactions really hard. But most of the tracks were delightful. Personal favourites were from 'Sam Webster' and 'Nick Nausbaum'."

I don't think achieves it though. Firstly because the game has a 3D camera, a double jump and a air-dash, and multitasking - it's hard for people who don't know how to play games. Secondly because the vibes are off. Let's talk about the vibes.",

Actually there are tons of great ideas in general, especially in terms of gameplay mechanics. But the two characters are so insufferable it hurts. One of them is happy-go-lucky and the other is sarcastic and rude. And as I learned playing the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, it drives me insane to see characters who have no social skills. This bitch Mio is so rude it blew me away. You are literally trapped in a fantasy land with a stranger and you don't take a moment to appreciate your never-seen-before surroundings or the fact that magic exists and just talk about it!

        "Decided to start off my year by replaying this absolute banger of a game. I really recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it. It's a timeless and wonderful game which really is more puzzle than action. Samus is a badass, and the vibes of the game are immaculate. She is totally alone on an alien planet and has to deal with a bunch of bullshit and take down this insane monster by herself, and she does it because she's fucking Samus. I really enjoyed reliving the soundtrack, and this time I particularly vibed with the music from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNp-gXZ7hy4\">Phendrana Drifts Depths</a>.",
        "This remake on the Switch is so fucking good. I'm not normally paying attention to performance and technical stuff, but I read that this game is kind of a miracle - it looks insanely good and also runs super smoothly at 60fps. The boys and girls at Retro Studios much be super experts at making video games, and the new Metroid Prime game is definitely gonna be so fucking good. I just need to know what they were working after they finished Donkey Kong Country. It's driving me crazy.",

        "I loved this game, specifically the second one as a child playing on the GBA. I got into this way before becoming a Fire Emblem fan! It took a bit of time for me to pick it up because I genuinely thought it would be crap. I thought the gameplay would have aged badly and the new look isn't exactly that appealing, but I'm totally hooked again!",
        "Gameplay-wise this is super fun. It's super satisfying to go for a specific strategy and see it pay off. One-shotting units with bombers or submarines or medium tanks... man there's nothing better. I will say though that it's tough! And the enemy AI has pulled off some genius shit. One gripe I do have is that some of the later battles with lots of bases and cities tend to go on for ages... I'm not finished playing the game as I'm writing this, but the map pictured below took me all afternoon. I have some strong memories of the end of the second game, so I guess I have that to look forward to next...",
        "Vibes-wise this game has a super weird direction. It's war but it also feels like playfighting between kids. The toy-box aesthetics and comically extreme characters really laugh in the face of the horrors of war. I'm not trying to criticise the game for this, it's just jarring! It's not trying to make any points about war or even tell a good story, it's just trying to be a banger strategy game, which it is. The soundtrack is a bop too - all the old themes I loved from back then, remade and with special individual tracks for when you activate your CO power (a much needed change)."

It takes place on an oil rig in the North Sea in the 70s. It's historically accurate and features some great Scottish voice acting. Then at the beginning of the game, the drill hits some kind of otherworldly monster which then proceeds to transform this open platform in the middle of the sea into terrifying deathtrap. It's good for people who aren't faint of heart like me."

        "Daaaaamn this game is wild! It's a visual novel unlike any other, and honestly worth checking out for the innovative way it tells a story alone. You have 13 whole-ass protagonists who all have intricately interconnected lives and stories, and you get to follow all their journeys in any order you like. Octopath Traveler, eat your heart out! Unlike that stiff storytelling with 8 entirely separate stories, hear all the characters interact and it is so exciting. I admit that it relies on some of those classic anime tropes a lot, but I allow it because the actual story is so wild and unpredictable. It's got all these great plot twists and because you decide what order to learn about them, discovering them makes it feel like YOU figured it out, or that you stumbled onto some juicy information that you shouldn't have found already. Delicious.",
        "It also has some real time strategy gameplay to mix up all the dialogue scenes which looking back were quite refreshing and nice. I didn't enjoy it so much when playing them, especially at the start, but actually they weren't too bad, and by the end I was getting quite good at it. Focus of this game is on the incredible and absolutely wild story though. Highly recommended."

At first I wasn't vibing with the characters, I mean it's not like smash where you already know the characters because it's motherfucking princess peach. But after you play around a bit, you'll eventually gravitate towards one character or another. For me, I landed on Maypul, a fast and tricky character who has some fun kill setups. At first I was drawn to her because of the duck hunt-like plant combos but I also really vibe with the pikachu-style small fast character energy.",

I played with some pros at a smash tournament recently and I got absolutely fucked up, and I dunno it's hard to describe but it was a total honour. I really do just need to git gud.",

        "Holy crap, is this game real? Dear visitors to this website, please consider dropping everything and buying this collection of 50 arcade games for the low price of 20 euros. You have to understand, this isn't just any old collection of NES/arcade-style games, these are all brand-new games! They've been developed with modern game design philosophy and ALL of the games are bangers. All 50 of them!",
        "This collection has everything: platformers, puzzle games, action games, top down strategy, RPGs, and plenty of wacky, hard-to-define-genre games as well. Each of them bring something new to the table, to the point where most of them could be expanded into their own indie games and they would be fucking great. Inevitably, not every game will be for everyone, but that's the beauty of UFO 50 - everyone can find something that suits their tastes in there, and everyone will also end up trying out different kinds of games that they would otherwise never touch.",
        "Personally I love puzzle games so I was delighted when the very first game I picked happened to be a block puzzle game called Block Koala. I got so into block koala and although I recognise why most people wouldn't rate the game very high, I totally clicked with it and very quickly 100%ed it. Camouflage was another banger puzzle game, so good.",
        "Other highlights for those who are interested were definitely Rail Heist, Vainger, Mortol 2, Night Manor, Party House and Hyper Contender. Block Koala still #1 though, maybe it's because it was the first one I picked. Feels like Block Koala and I have a special bond.",
        "One last thing I wanted to point out: this game has a huge and incredible chiptune soundtrack! Many of the tracks are even microtonal, which is something you hear almost never in video games. Hugely inspired and hugely inspiring. I couldn't pick a single recommendation so enjoy the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O-5JriuYm8s?feature=shared\">banger start-up music<a>."

The team did deliver on another high-standard zelda game, but I can't say I enjoyed playing through it as much as other zelda games. It's hard to say why, because the vibe is very much the same as Link's Awakening. I guess this vibe is closer to the beaten track. There's much less weird shit.",

Everytime I found a new monster I got excited about its echo, but always went back to my beloved, deku baba. I would describe my playstyle as Deku baba only. It's just so fast!",
        "I appreciated that we could finally play as zelda, but they made her a silent protagonist! There is no need. Link is already a silent protagonist and then they put the two of them together in the end and they literally couldn't have a conversation. It's gone too far! It also felt like I might as well have been playing as Link the whole time. Only when your name is cleared and you can start going round in your pink dress did I feel a swell of pride about playing as a princess."

This game is equally as bad as the first game, except it has more stuff in it!\n",

Having such a ridiculously convoluted story, bewildering cameos from disney characters and final fantasy characters just hanging out. Incredible that it happened. I can imagine that at the time, this game would have been so fucking crazy.",
        "The game features so many cameos it's actually ridiculous. All the stories and worlds are short and shallow so they can fit in more content. I think the appeal is more like \"wow I am riding Aladdin's magic carpet\" rather than \"this carpet minigame is fun\".",
        "One thing I appreciate about Kingdom Hearts is the stilted dialogue, which leads to the funniest cutscenes ever. I watched a \"kingdom hearts out of context\" video and it had me cackling. The comedic timing on some of the nonsense that the characters spout really does tickle me.",
        "I admit, I didn't engage with the battle system as much as I could have. I played on normal mode and mashed X to get through the game. Only at the very end of the game I realised you could increase your ability points by using items. In the final world I had a ridiculously difficult boss fight (Roxas) where the game suddenly turned into Elden Ring and I had to spend two hours increasing my level and learning his attack patterns. I was utterly unprepared and it didn't feel good to have to learn how to play the game then to beat him. In my defence, the player has to put in a lot of work to understand how stuff works. I'm used to modern games where things are properly explained.",

The main thing to note about it is the stop motion/clay animation style. It gives it a vibe of being somewhat of a parody, like Team America or something. It means even the serious parts you have to enjoy with a smile. This combined with some honestly excellent dialogue makes for a delightful little experience.",

All his colleagues speak down at him but in a loving way, and it's fun to see him deal with that. It's presented in a way that he might be depressed, but then he does find pleasure in the little interactions, because there are many delightful little quirks in the story to enjoy. After some twists in the story, you can see how his outlook changes, and it's handled quite maturely.",

It's based on a pretty interesting mechanic of swinging on your tongue, where you use momentum and timing to propel yourself through hand-crafted levels. It's something that you can get better at and is really satisfying when you get right. Many of the puzzles are based on timing jumps and letting go of your tongue at the precise moment when you will fly at just the right angle, which requires a good spatial understanding.",

Tongue Tale doesn't manage to do that (sorry Remke). The first world is a lot of fun, but somewhere in the second or third world the difficulty spikes so insanely quickly into the \"this is bullshit\" realm that it kinda detracts from the experience.

        "Holy moly is this a dream come true? I loved this game when I was younger and they've only gone and made it even better. The first and most important thing to talk about is the insane glow-up that the soundtrack got. It has truly gotten the Origami King treatment and I mean that in the best possible way. They've added new tracks, new variations of existing tracks, and boldly updated the old favourites which is almost always tasteful and successful. The battle theme has multiple variations depending on the region you're in and it's touches like that which turn a good game into a special game. You're in a mysterious off-colour forest and run into an enemy? Consider the vibe MATCHED.",
        "I will say that they added an Erhu (a very recognisable Chinese string instrument) to the Glitz pit music and it honestly sounds a bit off. In my opinion they should have gone for more of a lucha libre/WWE vibe but whatever it still sounds good.",
        "Another amazing update is the new expressions and animations all the characters have. Still the same as the original and yet injected with flair and love and care. Gameplay-wise they nerfed Power Bounce which thinking about it is probably a good thing. Some of the later boss battles can't be cheesed with it anymore.",
        "The OG game is so strong that you really can't go wrong and yet still my expectations were exceeded. The locations, the characters, the humour, the VIBE, it's all great, and absolute bonus it's a lot of fun to play too.",
        "I loved beating this game. I don't have the time that I used to for these things so I did it in little bursts. I even completed chapter 6 while on an overnight train! And beating the final boss was difficult just like I remember, but this time you can skip the cutscenes!!"

        "This is an indie game inspired by Pokemon where it's very much the same as Pokemon in many many ways but brings in some cool new gameplay features. In this game it's possible to fuse monsters together and they straight up made designs and names for every single combination (and there are over 100 of the things!). That alone is an incredible achievement and I was thoroughly enjoying seeing new combinations of my favourite mons even at the end of the game. However, there are so many of them that their specialness does kinda wear off after a while.",
        "It must have taken so long to do all the fusions... and I think the Dev time they spent on that should have been spent on... the rest of the game. It really is a technical mess! This game is glitchier than the newer Pokemon games which is impressive and the crazy loading screens and bad graphics is just on a different level. Normally I'm not too much of a bitch when it comes to this stuff, but it negatively affects the vibe of the game and is impossible to ignore. I can't recommend the game for that alone.",
        "One good thing was the open world aspect, you can go to any area whenever, which is great for catching cool mons. The worst thing about Pokemon (Well maybe not but for me a super annoying thing) is not being able to get a team of your faves early on in the game. All my faves are late game Pokemon and I'm pissed about that. The best thing about Pokemon is curating a team of my favourite mons and giving them all the love and attention that they deserve, watching them grow and beating the game with them. In cassette beasts I was able to find my faves (of course the dumbest designs ever, and this game has plenty of goofy ass mons that I'm immediately drawn to) and I was also able to swap them out easily because the levelling up is based on your character, not your mons, a great idea.",
        "To end this with another fat negative, the writing is terrible and generic. The premise is very forced, and even the interesting boss characters don't make much sense really. Also, I was not vibing at all with the soundtrack, some cheesy soft rock/indie songs with vocals. I was told it had a good OST but it wasn't good for my tastes and I ended up muting the game.",
        "Actually I'll end with a fat positive, the game features a delightful companion character who joins you towards the end, who single handedly brings a fantastic energy to the game, and when he comes with you at the end... just great."

        "This game has such a strong vibe it's insane. Everything is bioluminescent and dripping with water and it just looks so fucking rad. I love that you play as a tiny blob which can neatly fit through every gap. It's very polished and I respect that (just before this I played Cassette Beasts which is a bit of a technical mess so the contrast was there).",
        "This game has little to no background music which shocked me at first, because I am a lover of video game music. But it didn't take long for me to understand that that is crucial to the vibe of the environment. The sound design is super good even without the music - there is so much going on in terms of water dripping sounds, ambient noises, squelchy sounds as you move, it makes it all sound so real. And without the music it does give it that lonely metroid vibe. And on the occasions where music does play, it hits hard because of it. Interesting choice and although I'm a little upset because I'm sure a game with this vibe and colour scheme would have a beautiful twinkly soundtrack, I understand that not having music goes a long way to set this game apart from all the other super similar metroidvanias.",
        "This game is super similar to other metroidvanias, like it gave me heavy Axiom Verge vibes, which isn't a bad thing. It's got some very creative power-ups which are delightful, and focuses more on puzzle solving than combat, which I personally really appreciate. But there's another game which this clearly takes lots of inspiration from: Fez. Fez is this puzzler (also with a strong vibe) which you play through once, then it slowly dawns on you, that was just the beginning, and you are assaulted with many higher-level meta puzzles which turn the whole game on its head. Tunic was kinda similar too. Animal Well has the same thing going for it - you beat the game, and realise huh, there's more to it than this... you start digging and keep digging, and by the time you've reached some of the \"deeper\" parts of the well, you've already made a whole bunch of notes and are starting to go a bit crazy. I love that shit."

        "I've got a lot to say about this one so buckle up. As an enjoyer of the original FF7 and... I think I was an enjoyer of the previous game (Final Fantasy VII Remake), I felt the desire to play this game too. But I've been shocked by how horrifically sanitised it is. I think Remake was much the same but here it's even more so! I realised pretty quickly during this game that I'm not actually playing a game, I'm playing a product. I'm being served content and I'm supposed to enjoy it. After all this is a triple AAA big budget game that I paid full price for, and consumers like me have certain expectations. So the game gives me open world, generous dollops of fan-service, a whole ass card game, one thousand million mini games, a whole bunch of playable characters (including big seph), orchestral remixes of beloved old songs...",
        "It just all feels so forced! You can't escape it. Sure, this game has magic and love but it all stems from the very strong base of the original game. The world of FF7 is so fucking cool, with the world being overtaken by an energy company after they monopolise a new environment-destroying energy source. It's so topical, I love it. Seriously, play the original, it still holds up today and tells such a cool story about this fascinating world (a whole-ass planet, by the way). Rebirth isn't bad as such because it's built on this base. But what it adds is either annoying, superfluous or made without love.",
        "The worst offender is the open world. Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind an open world. But this one is less of an open world and more of a to-do list of pointless tasks in a big area. I have to go to the various spots and complete menial tasks in order to get a rush of dopamine as it is ticked off. Most aggravating for me was Chadley, the AI robot child character who sends Cloud off to do these super scripted ~I'm playing a video game~ tasks. Go defeat these monsters, go take a photo here, go activate this tower. What do I actually get out of this? Luckily I'm not actually invested enough in the gameplay to be interested in the materia you get from Chadley.",
        "One thing the open world does do is give the sense that you're exploring the whole planet. And I have to say it looks quite nice. The various towns all look fantastic as well. This is really a feast for the eyes, especially for those who played the original. Seeing Costa del Sol, Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon all looking so good is a treat. There are also lush, orchestral versions of the original soundtrack in these places, which is delightful.",
        "But while I'm talking about the soundtrack, I have to say that it's all over the place. The general vibe appears to be orchestral, but then it throws in the wacky stuff (certain sidequests, chocobo music, moogles, cactuars...) and the music goes all electronic and wild. There is also gratuitous jazz music here and there, and other random shit depending on what's going on. It feels like they're just cramming in as much content as possible. This is a recurring theme.",
        "Similar topic, this game switches from serious to silly so casually, it's jarring. The chocobos really are completely ridiculous! And there's something about seeing them in HD which makes it even wilder. In the OG, things happen so quickly and switch themselves up so regularly and you don't even bat an eyelid if you need to ride a chicken through the swamp. The vibe is so strong that silly things can coexist with the serious main story. In this remake, the silly, cartoonish things simply look so out of place, I can't take anything seriously.",
        "Two of the main characters (Red 13 and Cait Sith, my fave from the OG) are so outlandish in this game that it takes away any hopes of seriousness when they're involved. Actually despite that, I'm super happy with how they did Cait Sith because that really isn't easy to translate from the PS1 version and he looks and sounds great. Red 13 though, god the thing with his voice in Cosmo Canyon is so dumb, and he doesn't have any personality apart from that. He was way cooler in the OG I can't even describe. As for the other characters, Aerith and Barret are fine, they're both delightful. Tifa I can't even say anything because any semblance of a personality is completely eclipsed by her humongous knockers. Those badockadonks have their own field of gravity they are that huge. Whenever she's on screen I can't help but make an out-loud comment about how needlessly massive her tits are. Yuffie is beautifully animated, but her outfit from the original really needed an update. She's really a ninja, and trying to make a sleeveless, crop-top, turtlenecked, knitted woollen jumper work.",
        "The worst offender though is Cloud. God I hate how useless he is in social situations. They made him stand-offish and distant so that he looks like a badass, but to me he's just a dickhead. Aerith is trying so hard to make conversation and she is just suffering because Cloud just leaves her on read constantly. And somehow, the group all still tolerate him, nay revere him?? He literally does bad spoiler thing in the Gongaga reactor and Tifa is like, you good Cloud no worries babe. AT LEAST Cloud has some decent sexual tension with Sephiroth, who spends 80% of his screen time just glaring. I'm kinda into that.",
        "That was a lot of words about the vibe of the game, here's my review of the gameplay: The battle system in the game is really good. It took me a while to get into it (I'd forgotten everything from the previous game) but it's satisfying and fun. I also enjoy the Queen's Blood card game a lot. It's cool that there aren't any loading screens."

It's the colours you see first thing when you wake up in the morning when you're still woozy and coming to. It reminds me of this game I played as a child \"Zool 2\" in terms of vibe. Something very special!",
        "I do feel like the character of Penny is a bit random. Her design is just a bunch of elements thrown together and doesn't have so much of a personality. There is some missed potential there, especially with the \"big breakaway\" part of the game. It doesn't feel like you're running away, but rather like you're going through some levels. If it were me, I would have gone for Penny running away constantly, with animations reflecting her fear/excitement, kinda like in Pizza Tower.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun, it's a momentum game kinda like Sonic, which makes sense because it's from the same devs as Sonic Mania (one of the best games ever). And by the end of the game I kinda got it with the loop, dash and jump moves. At the start though it was really hard, and I kept hitting walls and being bad and it was frustrating. I didn't feel the need to replay levels and do them better.",
        "One thing about the game is that you can choose whether you go through slowly and find all the collectibles and unlock difficult levels, go for mega points by having a big combo, or speedrunning. Different strokes for different folks but I was totally unsure about what I wanted! I wish I could have been told what to do in that regard, but that's just me.",
        "One last thing: I regret playing this on the switch. The graphics and framerate are bad and not in a good way. When I watched some gameplay from the PC version after finishing the game I was so shook!"

The same because you're metroidvania-ing around just like Zero mission or Super Metroid, fighting similar bosses, living your normal life. Gameplay-wise I did think to myself, this game is just like the others. But that's not a bad thing, it's a great formula.",
        "What it does differently is the vibe. This game is way more of a horror game than other ones - you can see where the blueprint for Metroid Dread is. There are some genuinely horrible & creepy moments. The first time you see the SA-X, or when you encounter a certain someone encased in ice, the introduction of one of the bosses towards the end where you first see its corpse... It's so good. Terrifying. The music really adds to it as well.",
        "It's way more linear in the sense that this computer tells you what to do at any point but I really appreciated that because I didn't enjoy in Super metroid how sometimes you had to decide on your own to go to a completely different sector to progress. It still left many things open in many cases so I still felt super smart finding my way around a lot of the time. There were like two points where I had to look up the answer because to be fair it was completely ridiculous. This one hole you have to find in the water sector is just so dumb, and the comments on the youtube video which shows the whole made me feel better about looking it up."

        "It was fun learning what was really broken in the game and what could be ignored. Like in slay the spire, card draw is super important, but in this game not so much - I would say energy is way more important. Also, movement is far more powerful than shielding. Pretty cool."

You play a larger man who dives in a special location which contains all the fish in the world and then sells them as sushi. It's a wild premise and one that I really enjoy. I love that you just get real life fish and literally everything can be eaten. Even the bosses are just sharks and shit (for the most part).",
        "Dave the character is just great, he is often sidelined and people are kinda rude to him but he just takes it in his stride. He loves what he does and has a great positive mindset and you just love to see it. He's surrounded by some other amazing characters, like the sushi chef. Their little dialogues are always great, and all the characters are beautifully characterised by these amazing short pixel art cutscenes. They are SUCH a pleasure to watch always.",

        "But I don't think I'd recommend this game to friends, because it is just sooooo slow. Diving in general is slow, and the story progresses really slowly. There are a million side quests, including this eco-app where you are encouraged to collect certain items. You get so little out of these quests, but I found myself obsessively getting everything all the time. It's meant to be a relatively chill game but I found myself optimising and making sure I could complete everything, which resulted in a bunch of super long dives.",
        "As the game goes on, it continuously piles on new mechanics, minigames, stuff that is clearly designed to keep you interested, as the core gameplay of shooting your harpoon at fish will get old quick. That's cool and all but by the end you have so much shit on, that it's almost overwhelming. I spent more time farming, transferring fish from the fish farm, asking myself which recipes I wanted to upgrade, playing these dumb phone minigames than actually diving. They just cram the game full of new content, and it's not even good. Like each new mechanic is so shallow that it gets old very quickly.",
        "This fucking phone game which is like tamagotchi was what did it for me. Like why am I spending my time on this. They literally give you a phone that you can check for all the various game content, including a sushi version of instagram, and you end up just staring at it for ages. I truly don't think this game is a comment on how we are addicted to our phones. I just think they put too much shit into the game and it got boring. This would have been way better on a smaller scale in my opinion."

You have to get lucky with the pills, because there isn't a good strategy for what to do when you get the wrong pills. You have to constantly go for vertical rows of 4 because the horizontal ones are just so risky.",

        "This game is super dumb. My friend Fab lent me the physical game and for some weird reason I ended up completing it. I admit that swinging around town is kinda fun, and towards the end I got better at the game and it was kinda satisfying using all the special abilities. That being said, I played the game on easy because I had no time for dying over and over against some goons.",
        "Wild that this game has web slinging moments, watching a movie moments, and then they pad out the time with swinging fists at goons and even stealthing around (?). Luckily I didn't need to stealth much because I was playing on easy. But it all felt very forced when I was doing all these epic stunts and then bam I'm in a building and have to fight some dudes for a bit.",
        "But god the story is just so ridiculous. I mean it's classic superhero nonsense and it's why I don't have any time for superhero films. There's just so much ridiculousness, like these hunters. There's this dude with too much money who likes hunting, and he has hundreds (thousands?) of loyal cultists who came with him from Foreign Country to New York, all of them willing to die for the cause. All trained in martial arts? There's this character called Black Cat who randomly finds a magic portal. Like, just magic is a thing.",
        "Venom as a thing is fascinating to me. How is this eldritch-horror ooze thing so popular? Everything surrounding this storyline was super predictable.",
        "The worst offender for this game is the very generic soundtrack. Boring ass movie music with no character. They should have given this game an actual vibe like the into the spiderverse film. I also resented how everything just gets destroyed all the time. Spiderman and his escapades just end up destroying every environment they're in.",

This is particularly wild because this story is part of the Kingdom Hearts lore and they put it in the collection so players can follow the story chronologically. Feels like super bad planning.",

At this point I'm so far gone that I'm just letting the bizarre vibes of this entry in the series wash over me. Maybe Kingdom Hearts 2 will be a real game."

        "It's an action game like the main one, except the attack you do depends on what your next card is. So in order to get good at the game you have to manage your cards, and also fight in a 3D arena like in the first game. All is well and good but then you meet some boss and it's impossible to get past. I personally struggled with this bitch Larxene (shown in pic) halfway through the game. She is such a bitch I hate her so much.",
        "It completely recycles all the assets from the first game and just tells another bewildering story. At this point I'm just letting it all wash over me. We are introduced to a bizarre shadowy organisation full of villains who all speak with an irritating sarcastic tone constantly. It's a wonder that any of these characters get anything done because they don't know how to communicate at all.",
        "At some point in the game I decided I was in too deep and committed to completing the whole thing. I was forced to look up tactics for how to cheese some of these bosses because towards the end those health bars end up being ridiculously big. Cheesing works to an extent, but I have to admit, I had to get kinda good at the game to beat the bosses... maybe it wasn't so bad.",
        "What was bad was realising that when I completed the game, there's a whole second playthrough with Riku with a new story and new battle mechanics. I had to play it. That shit was also bullshit, just like the main game, and there were fewer opportunities to cheese opponents. Still, I did it. Beating Ansem at the end was really hard but I did it. Mickey Mouse randomly appeared. Riku is caught being edgier than ever before. I can't get over how different this game is to Kingdom Hearts 1."

She is just all over the map and all she does is hate on Gruntilda. It is so funny and I love the energy. Sometimes she's hiding in a corner somewhere and just pops up to say that Gruntilda is disgusting because she eats maggots for breakfast. Sets me off everytime.",

Having to collect all the music notes from the start whenever you die is miserable, and the jiggies are not signposted properly. The music is really good though, but of course I would say that as a lover of Donkey Kong 64 (proven to be a terrible game).",

I was just amazed that they managed to secure the rights to all these characters and worlds. Although by the end, having had my standards set so low, I found myself forming opinions on them. Why does Neverland only take place on a boat? It was kinda cool that you can be a mermaid in Atlantica... and the music in Agrabah isn't too bad. Those gummi ship sections though, terrible.",

I couldn't not see it.",

Actually I wondered if it was a little too over-engineered, taking away the magic a bit. But I couldn't deny that the little game design things they implemented were all great. Things like old paths closing off if it's definitely the wrong way to go, or pleasant music playing when you start solving a puzzle in the right way."

You start the game inside an egg and you have to be born, but not before you get some kind of seed implanted inside of you. You are tasked by what appears to be a religious entity (the Centre) to rid the world of dust and bring about the Anodyne, something like a rapture (the word \"anodyne\" means painkiller). As you go around removing the evil dust, the seed inside you watches as you do your job. The evil dust affects the citizens of the weird and wonderful world, and you remove it, numbing the pain and \"clarifying\" things for them.",

There are many points in the game where you can draw parallels to how we grow up, how our parents affect us, our relationship with entities like \"the Centre\", and many many other things. The game is dripping with meaning.",

Sea of stars has just such a great vibe. I really enjoy the character designs and the environments and the lighting especially. There's an ability that lets you change the time of day and it looks soooo good, I've never seen anything like it.",

The battle system is a lot of fun, especially with the timed inputs and breaking of opponent's big moves, and I never groaned when I had a battle. However it doesn't have too much depth. It takes a long time before the characters learn any new attacks and when they do, they're never gamechanging. In fact I spent all the game using moonerang because it's simply the strongest attack. On top of that, one of the moves 'disorient' can really be abused to stop bosses ever doing their strong attack, which resulted in me missing all exciting animations from the final boss, which was a bit lame.",
        "Next part has some light story spoilers...",

They have no personality, they just go around winning battles and solving problems like boring heroes. How did they survive 10 years of isolation and training and then become perfectly well rounded heroes? The previous solstice warriors ended up not being well-rounded at all. The other characters are also pretty plain, with the exception of Resh'an, which was a genuine pleasant surprise. I appreciate that there was little dialogue, because it gave off those old fashioned SNES vibes, but it did mean that there was little to no character development. It's a shame because I like the designs.",
        "When it comes to world building, I have a couple of questions. If we're dealing with multiple timelines and universes, why are we just focusing on two of them? How did we end up consistently going between these two specifically using the vast sea of stars? Considering the name of the game is sea of stars, the whole concept isn't very well explored. I mean we got this insane, super cool warp sequence there, but even though we traverse the sea multiple times, we never see that again.",
        "One thing about the lore which I did enjoy were the stories told by Teaks. They're perfect fantasy fairytales which work really well with the minimal dialogue, set to nice music and revealed at points in the story when you haven't figured it out yourself yet.",
        "In conclusion, this is a game which does have that X factor which is so rare in the wealth of video games we are bombarded with these days, but it has some things holding it back from being one of my favourites. I did push through all 30 hours though, which says something"

I'm pretty sure the actual card game is super unbalanced and bullshit, but these battles are a lot of fun. It's genuinely a pleasure to build decks and fight with them, and it's hard to describe why.",
        "I immediately got attached to Staryu, because it can do 20 damage with one energy, and also happens to be one of my favourite pokemon. My water &amp; rock deck took me through almost the whole game and I even felt proud of it.",
        "The art of the pokemon is sooo good. I've already cross-stitched Horsea and Koffing from this game. And the music is super good for a gameboy game as well. It's on the switch online for free, so definitely play it!"

        "This game, man. It's just so camp! The theatrics of it... it definitely doesn't take itself seriously and is better off because of it. The story is about war and normal fire emblem stuff, but then the characters are just so ridiculous. Every chapter there is a new ridiculously dressed person who joins your party and you just have to take it as it is. It's actually really funny and entertaining because of that.",
        "I'm a long time Fire Emblem fan, so I'm used to the gameplay and I enjoyed it! This time for the first time I played on casual mode (as opposed to classic mode, where you have permadeath) and it GREATLY improved my gameplay experience. I didn't have to reset when someone got hit with a critical hit! I should have used this option the whole time. To balance it out, I also played on hard mode, which made the game more fun, although I was resentful that my playtime extended very long because of it. Also a little bit of me is unsatisfied because I switched it to normal difficulty for the final boss... I just ran out of patience.",
        "This game brings back 12 main characters from previous fire emblem games as the \"emblems\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. I am a total sucker for this kind of thing - references to older games, representation of different eras... I loved seeing Micaiah from Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, or Eirika from Sacred Stones. So cool. I just wish the emblems actually had personalities. They are all boring as hell.",

        "I love Pikmin with my whole heart. There's something special about it. The combination of the focus on nature, the soundtrack, the wacky characters, and the kinda dark elements combine to give it a certain X factor which is hard to pin down with words. When I think about whether games are good, they can get approval from me for a variety of reasons. Like Slay the spire is just great gameplay. But most of my favourite games just have great vibes.",
        "The vibe of pikmin is so fucking strong that it's insane, and the gameplay is good enough that it's fun to spend time in the game soaking up the vibe. The first pikmin arguably had the worst gameplay but the strongest vibe. The time limit, as well as harshness of the environment, and some highlights like the first encounters with specific bosses. Lots of bullshit with pikmin killing themselves, general difficulty. It is a great time and might be my favourite pikmin.",
        "The second pikmin game is a lot bigger and also has vibes in spades. The areas are super nice, music is fantastic (I love the piklopedia), and gameplay significantly improved with having two captains. The caves seemed pretty random though - like time stops when you're down there and then you've just got this ability to go back to the previous floor if you lose too many pikmin. I feel like it takes away from the general feeling of the game, and it's more like bonus content.",
        "Pikmin 3 is super interesting. It's fucking gorgeous, has beautiful areas and possibly the best music of all. It also does away with the caves, and instead just has a really big overworld, which brings back that pikmin 1 vibe a lot. I never liked how the treasures were just fruits though, that seemed pointless. It also added mission mode, which was the best thing ever in terms of gameplay - these super fun little challenge modes. The final boss was also very special.",
        "Now after 10 years we finally get Pikmin 4 and I have been excited for it, even more so than for Zelda. In terms of gameplay, everything is there. Quality of life changes to the max, meaning that pikmin actually do what they're told, all the pikmin content you could wish for. All the old bosses coming back, caves, hours of gameplay. I had a fun time collecting all the treasures and completing everything.",
        "But something's off. The game feels like a huge collection of content being thrown in. More is more! The caves are more content, the dandori challenges (like pikmin 3 mission mode) are great but integrated into the game like extra content. They brought back the (terrifying in pikmin 2) waterwraith and it felt empty. It just dropped two of them in the final dungeon. Doing that really takes away the special vibe of that particular boss. I realised that in pikmin 4, vibe was sacrificed for more content, and that this is true for many games these days.",
        "The quality of life changes &amp; powered up rewind function makes it so it's very easy to get through the game without losing pikmin, so stakes are way lower now. I think I miss the chaos of the first two pikmins where one misstep can cause your whole squad to get flattened without warning. Electricity immediately killing them, the gatling groinks, yellows throwing bombs back at you. There's something delicious about that.",
        "On top of that, the music isn't so great. The Olimar sidequest tracks are great, but otherwise it's gone a different direction: now it has ultra adaptive music (something the series is famous for and a big contributor to the X factor) but it's so adaptive to the point it's barely recognisable. There are multiple layers which fade in and out depending on what enemy you're fighting, what you're carrying etc. Nothing you can hum.",
        "They also retconned the lore, and it was \"all a dream\" or something. They had Louie be the bad guy but then cleared things up after, and there were no open questions left like in Pikmin 2. There was no weird shit like the Pikmin 3 final boss. And final complaint: I wish they integrated the night time/glow pikmin sections better.",
        "But to end on a positive, I really loved getting platinum medals in the dandori challenges, and those final ones were tough as nails. I still loved this game. I even painted a picture of Oatchi for my living room!"

        "Playing this game felt a lot like playing Breath of the Wild back in 2017, although it has to be said: nothing can truly recreate that feeling of magic we all felt back then. It's undeniably a better game, but some of that magic is gone the second time around. It's super interesting because it's forcing me to reflect on why I enjoyed playing BotW more, despite it being emptier and more annoying. How we enjoy games really depends on so many things, not just the game itself. In this case, it was because there really wasn't anything like it before.",
        "Anyway here we are in 2023 playing Zelda again and it's a lot of fun. The new abilities are nice. I was actually in it for the new content, music, areas and surprises though. There was a lot to enjoy, but it really does rely on existing content a bit too much. I wish exploring Hyrule wasn't so similar to how it was before.",
        "I really loved some of the new stuff though. The new temples, great! Especially that gorgeous Lightning Temple music, hell yes. Getting from A to B using a ratchet flying machine, great.

I also enjoyed using the spear at a weapon. I used that spear to get me through Margit and also two other big bosses.",

And the game is actually good. It's so good that I organise all the motherfucking tournaments for it in Berlin and compete in it myself even. This game is just the bees knees, it has everything. There are so many characters, and so of course I naturally gravitate towards my favourites. There's something for everyone here.",

As a child I remember early smash games the difference between learning how to Up-B back to stage, or how to use roll and spotdodge, and not knowing that stuff. That was like level 1 smash. Fastforward to today and I'm on like level 10 smash, playing in competitive tournaments. Now it's all about specific match up knowledge, having a gameplan and changing your gameplan mid-game. It's about mind games and understanding what your opponent will do. It's an actual fighting game and it turns out I'm super into that. Playing in tournament has been so satisfying, and I have loved slowly getting better over the years.",

Going to tournaments is just so fun, and sure the community itself is full of nerds, and mostly they are boys, there are also a bunch of cool people, and there's no money involved. So it's an actual grassroots community, all just getting together for the love the game, and that is so cool. Now I'm a community leader and I do a lot of very fulfilling work for the community. It's nice and has inspired me to look for more community in my life.",

I love that she has the float mechanic, which makes her able to move unlike any other character. It also means she has a very good disadvantage, so I don't have to be frustrated about not being able to get back to stage. Early smash ultimate days I even got some great results with her, but that's because she was a monster in the early meta. These days, the meta has been overcrowded with bullshit characters and camping, but luckily it doesn't hinder too much my enjoyment of the local tournaments that I put on. That being said, he's hoping for a switch 2 edition which nerfs Steve!",

There are many words in the world! I started small but ended up testing the limits of the system pretty quickly. It's very easy to cheese all the levels after a bit of experimenting. Kudos to the devs for trying though."

It was everything I could ever want from a zelda game and more! And it had this beautiful artstyle which totally captured my imagination.",

The game just has so many good moments and such good music to go with it. Is it flawless? No. But the HD remake is!"

When the gorons hug you, the Deku tree dying, the whole of Jabu Jabu's belly, the part where the fat zora slowly moves over, seeing Kakariko as an adult, meeting the kokiri as an adult, stopping the rolling goron, the wild cutscene with sheik in Kakariko village, gerudo fucking fortress, all the little mini dungeons in ganon's tower, the FINAL BOSS I mean hello.",

I mean what a VIBE. Then spirit temple, water temple too, so good. Classics like Kakariko village, Kokiri forest, Zora's domain, still 10/10 to this day.",

I loved exploring the world and finding secrets and treasures. I loved free roaming and hanging out. Doing the missions was also cool I guess. There's a point in the game where you can just start stealing airplanes and fly them around. I remember feeling like anything was possible!",
        "Wild that the first time I had those feelings was with grand theft auto! This game taught me everything I knew back then about black culture in America, as well as gang violence and prostitution. There I was, a child, going around shooting gang members, having sex with prostitutes, I even remember becoming a pimp in one mission. Looking back I think it gave me a kind of baseline understanding of a bunch of real issues in America that was totally warped. You can just fuck a prostitute then kill her to get the money back, it's totally fucked up. I remember really enjoying the missions where you just drive round in a fire truck and put out fires. Because I was a child. And there I was, also expanding the gang's territory in these crazy shoot-outs in the streets.",

But it's wild that so many of us played this in our formative years. I know that I didn't think about the wealth of social issues the game brings up with any sort of critical eye.

I think it looks so nice! The soundtrack is also top class. It's perfect for use in your DnD campaign. The boss battle music is insanely good.",
        "I really loved Tressa. She's a total babe and I made sure to play her story to the end. In order to do that though, I had to play the stories of all the other 7 characters, even though they were all completely unrelated. The game is split into four sections, and in each section you have to complete some story for each character. When I finally got to the fourth and final section, I just did Tressa's story then called it quits. Why? Because this game is fucking exhausting. It's so long. The boss battles take over an hour sometimes. I remember doing one of them while taking a bath, and deciding to get out of the bath before finishing the fight. Which is ridiculous if you think about it. I should be able to complete one boss fight in one bathtime. I feel like that's an unwritten rule that until this point has been largely respected.",
        "The worst thing about this game though is the fact that it's 8 different stories which have no relation with one another. The characters barely even talk to each other! Why even have 8 stories like this if they don't interact? They could have built a beautiful world with tons of related characters and storylines but no it's super separated and therefore boring. And it makes no sense why they're all travelling together. This really pissed me off when trying to enjoy the story. For such a long game, having to play 8 very shallow stories with no meat to them was just lame.",

I love how you can roll to go super fast and jump out of it, maintaining your speed. Actually this is kind of a speedrunning game! I even did all the speed challenges on all the levels to get the gold medals, and it was so hard! Donkey Kong games are unafraid to go there in terms of difficulty. Only being able to be hit twice is kinda hardcore if you think about it.",

The first level's music tells you everything you need to know about the vibe of the game. Then later on there's a world based on the Alps, then the African savannah, then some of the most gorgeous underwater levels ever, then this insane jungle island where the levels showcase harvest fruits, turning them into juice, putting them into moulds, freezing them to make ice lollies that the boss eats! Insane.",

The first boss Big Top Bop randomly goes SO HARD. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=301s-GDML5w&ab_channel=piplupwater\">Seriously check it out</a>. The smooth sax in the credits theme.

JESUS! This game is dark. There were so many parts where I was scared as a child. Even the mask salesman with this face he pulls was scary. Everything about the Majora's Mask itself was terrifying. Like the it stares at you with wide-open eyes like a lemur, horrible. And most of all I was terrified of the aliens in Lon Lon Ranch. What the fuck.",

Realistic-looking zelda with good graphics? This was going to be huge. And it was! When it came out I dropped everything and steamed through it, showing off to friends at school how quickly I was getting through it. It was amazing and I loved it.",
        "They really went to a new, creepy place in this game. Such a shock after the delightful Wind Waker. The whole twilight realm is its own special version of creepy, but the characters and vibes of the normal world are also totally creepy too. The designs of the characters are very out there indeed.",
        "There are so many great moments, like going to the bird city, the lost woods, the yetis, the bug collector, the ugly father figure, the battle on the bridge, the final boss. Also this game features one of the scariest zelda moments ever: the floating hands in the palace of twilight. Even as a teenager at this point I was fucking terrified.",
        "The soundtrack is stunning. So many classics like Faron Woods, Hyrule Field, Lake Hylia, but also sleeper hits like the music when you're a wolf in Ordon Village, the Ordon Ranch music, the Fishing hole music, or all the miniboss music. So much to enjoy!"

It builds on the foundation of the previous game, the Binding Blade, which featured Roy, and actually turns it into a good strategy game with some depth. It's the story of Roy's father Eliwood and his two mates Lyn and Hector. The story is exactly what you expect from Fire Emblem but it's still a nice time, and you get to switch around the characters a bit which is fun. Lyn is very likeable!"

        "This game means so much to me. I know its world and soundtrack so intimately having played it so many times. It took me many years to complete it, because I was too dumb as a child to know where I had to go next. Although I admit the game does not signpost where you should go. You are forced to roam the world and find stuff, which today is kinda unacceptable bad game design, but back then resulted in me putting the game down and coming back when I was a couple of years longer. I remember the boss key in Bottle Grotto was a hard barrier for me for YEARS.",
        "Later when I little by little discovered the delights the game has to offer, the trading quest, the animal village, the scene with Marin on the beach, the face shrine, and each time I was a little bit older. It was so cool. Eventually beating it was a huge moment.",
        "This game has SUCH a kooky vibe. It's bizarre and almost creepy with a bunch of really weird stuff. The whole having your name changed to THIEF if you steal the bow and arrow is really funny. I remember being devastated when I did that as a child - you mean I can't change my name back??",
        "But it's also quite melancholic. When you discover the truth of the island in the face shrine (incredible music by the way), the tone shifts quite a lot. The ending feels almost like death, it's kinda wild. Unlike any other zelda game."

I was very invested in giving Alex his egg everyday that he loved, so that I could get him to marry me. This is when I learned that I like soft jocks.

There was this sick website where Sakurai revealed new stuff about the game every day. At some point I watched all the cutscenes of the subspace emissary from the Japanese release out of pure hype, spoiling everything for myself. The build up was feverish.",

That stuff gave me life. My favourite character, Ice Climbers, even got a little cameo towards the end and I loved it. I was devastated you only have them for one level, and that level with Meta Knight, who I hated.",

In legendary Stickerbrush Symphony remix, the Dark World remix, With Mila's Divine Protection, which was THE track of subspace emissary. Fucking Unfounded Revenge, Underground Theme, Luigi Circuit, Ending Yoshi's Story, Butter Building, Meta Knight's Revenge, Fire Field. And you unlocked them with CD items!

I accepted all the bullshit this game has to offer with grace because it was magical. I loved Lanky Kong and also Tiny Kong.

Whoever is in charge of composing must spend so much time to make such rich and dense music. It really has its own special flair that is instantly recognisable as Kirby, AND they add all the mechanical/robot vibes seamlessly into it as well.",
        "The game itself is super polished and fun, and these amazing boss fights. I don't think I'll ever forget the final boss either, which feels like an insane set piece. Kirby even copies the Halberd! Anything in order to deliver the classic Kirby cosmic horror final boss. Love it.",

I think there was potential for a yarn-based chill out kirby game if they made a good soundtrack, but this music is very generic and just sounds bad. There are some alright remixes of classic kirby tracks but nothing too noteworthy. Yoshi's Woolly World was way better."

Sometimes it was really hard and there this one boss in the middle which actually had me stuck to the point where I took a break. Glad I finished it though.",

The music and design of the creatures really reflects that. Also, the premise is wild. But I like that it's a very Nintendo-y real time stategy game.",

Games really do big game-long time limits like this after Pikmin, for good reason. It's super stressful! But this game is still resonating vibes so much harder than all the other games in the series.",

The Beady Long Legs, being completely submerged with blue pikmin, the weird goo creature in the starting area, the Smoky Progg, the slideshow of all the creatures in the credits sequence. So much to love. This game is also very janky and is missing a lot of the quality of life stuff that Pikmin 4 really nails. Sometimes it's so hard to whistle all your pikmin, sometimes the pikmin just fall over while running and you have to wait for them, sometimes they just fucking die."

        "This game is quite dark, even though it's jokey on the surface. True to form for this series, it dissolves into nightmare fuel by the end of the game. I really like the whole part where you go into the past and hear that shocking music as you approach Giygas. I remember playing this together with my friend Claire and she was truly shook by the imagery of this last part. I mean I hate to spoil the game a bit but if you play the game, you understand. Honestly, Giygas is very yonic and is very much giving 'vagina', and I totally agree with all the theories that the swirling red shape is a fetus. It becomes very shocking with the screen starts glitching and Paula starts praying. Like wow this game didn't need to go this hard.",
        "I love the soundtrack so much. I love the battle music, it's so fucking weird. And the Sanctuary Guardian music is so wild, who came up with this as the boss music? It's so moody and I love it. There's this part where you get a bike and this awesome music plays. Except you can only ride a bike for a short while because soon after you get other party members who don't have bikes, so you can't ride it anymore. There's this amazing part where you have some coffee and this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o7vmukGvMpA?feature=shared\">trippy music</a> plays and you receive a pep talk about how far you've come so far. I love the music for Onett, Twoson, Threed and Fourside, and many other places. And huge shoutouts to 'Because I Love You', which plays everywhere after you beat the game. You can go back and talk to everyone in the game while listening to it, and they have some little gem of wisdom to share before you go home. It's beautiful. And 'Smiles and Tears', the credit song? Ugh. Amazing."

Eventually though, more and more people at school quit it because they saw it for what it really was: a soulless money making scheme.

The concept of having springy arms and fighting like that is hilarious, why the fuck not, and the game is wacky enough to make it fun. Also, in terms of being a competitive fighting game, it's surprisingly deep! Infinite different combinations of arms mean lots of strategies and stuff like that. I once commentating an online ARMS tournament and learned so much shit about all the different strats, it was sick. Tragically the scene isn't too big so getting good at the game isn't really a thing but it remains a hilarious party game (with motion controls of course).",

I made a mix for it, you can download it in the music section!"

It looks great and is a beautiful reimagining of how DKC looks, the music is pretty good and the game is full of great moments. The spider level is genuinely scary, the factory levels are super cool, World 4 is just the super fun minecart and rocket barrel levels, which are great, and this game invented the amazing silhouette levels. The sunset level was so inspiring that I painted a picture of it for my house.",
        "The game is also one of the best platformers ever, the rolling mechanic is so cool, because if you jump from a roll you keep the momentum, and it lets you fly through levels at breakneck speeds. After you beat the game you can try and speedrun the levels for these medals and I loved doing that! This was one of the only times I really got into the doing things fast aspect of gaming. Otherwise generally the game is kinda hard with only 2 health points. I remember this game taught me to git gud at platformers.",
        "Also this game is great because everything has a sensible context. Like there are no floating platforms, but rather all the platforms are part of other structures that make sense in the context of the level. And you have to really pay attention to the environment because there are these puzzle pieces hidden everywhere in secret nooks and crannies. Man, this game also taught me to find secrets! By the end I was able to spot all the clues for hidden areas like it was nothing. Platformers since this game have got nothing on me, I can find all the secrets. Unless they're bullshit. Luckily, in this game secrets are never bullshit, they are always somehow signposted. Great game design, love it"

I remember having a third party member, a Ledyba called Mavis who was genuinely an excellent addition to the team because she knew a confuse move.

The new ones, Studiopolis, Press Garden, Mirage Saloon and Titanic Monarch are all 10/10 they just smashed it. They look fantastic and the music is top notch. The MUSIC!!!",

Somehow he ended up writing the music for an official Sonic game and he fucking knocked it out of the park. He also remixed all these old tracks with such love, and for the new act 2 versions of a few of them, went ham on a remixed version of them. I just adore Green Hill's act 2, as well Oil Ocean's.

Metroid Prime 1 is an all-time classic. Incredible how they took the metroidvania principle and translated it perfectly into 3D. It's just so fun and the vibes are so strong. I also played Metroid Prime 2 and loved it. Maybe it's a little less iconic but it's still got all that good stuff.",

I ended up not finishing it, which I regret, but I've since read online that lots of people feel the same way. Despite this, I'm giving the trilogy a perfect score because it contains Metroid Prime 1, which is one of the greatest games ever."

Personally I love it, and I think this is the predecessor to things like Tomodachi Life. The weird shit they make you do in this game is so out there and wild, I can't help but love it. The minigames are all about 4 seconds long, and it's about reacting to them quickly. Except you have to fight your bafflement and just do it without asking why you're making a lady sniff her snot, or why you're skiing down a mountain all of a sudden, or why you need to pick a nose.",

Suddenly it's such a vibe. I love it.",

During this time I didn't have the hardware to connect my gameboy to the N64 so the rentals were all I had but I was satisfied.",

There are endless 'ambience and music from Hollow Knight for studying' compilations on youtube for a reason. The music is so sombre and peaceful and unlike anything else really. Then when the boss music hits, it's fucking great, it's dramatic but still fits the vibe of the gloomy caves. When I listen to tracks like 'Hornet battle' I enjoy how it sounds like baroque music.",

        "Gameplay-wise this game is also a 10. It's super open, meaning you can go anywhere really, and for a metroidvania you'd think that would be a problem but it straight up isn't. At some point you learn about the goal of the game and you have some directions on the map but all in all it's just about vibing through the various locations at your leisure and finding all this cool shit. At some point everything changes when you can double jump and you just want to go through the whole world again looking for secrets.",
        "The combat is sooooo satisfying! You have loads of short, fast attacks, but the enemies have lots of health so you have to hit them many times. But if you get good at it, you can kill stuff quickly with a flurry of blows and it feels great. The bosses are not your standard hit-them-three-times affair, but rather require you to fit in as many of these tiny hits in as possible between attacks. When you get hit yourself you it feels BAD, like the whole screen goes black and it HURTS. Sound design really helps with that and no game nails sound design like this one.",

I personally was never able to defeat the Radiance and to this day I feel bad about it, but that hasn't stopped me from replaying this game 2 times and getting enjoyment out of it that way. Also did I mention that all the characters in this game are bugs? It's an insect game! And it has INSANE lore.

You go around doing all these races, there's a great hub world to go around with lots of challenges, and the story is all about defeating the ugly-ass Wizpig by beating him in a race. Love it. That wizpig race was randomly so fucking hard. But if you beat it you unlocked the space levels!!! Nothing was more exciting for me than after years to finally see the lighthouse turn into a rocket.",
        "I love and cherish all of the racetracks and know them all like the back of my hand. I know all the shortcuts. Dear reader, you cannot defeat me at this game because I am a pro. Later in life I even learned how to go fast by tapping the accelerator button, and beat all the staff ghosts. This might be the first game I got good at. And unlike Mario Kart, there are no bitch-ass blue shells to make you lose even if you're the better racer. This game isn't socialist.",
        "But no, the reason this game is one of the greatest of all time is its soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope who did Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. It's iconic. All the tracks are timeless. I named my youtube channel 'Darkmooncaverns19' after the space-themed level on the same name. I fucking love these in particular: Fossil Canyon, Hot Top Volcano, Walrus Cove, Whale Bay, Pirate Lagoon, Boulder Canyon, Greenwood Village, Haunted Woods, Spacedust Alley, Darkmoon Caverns, Spaceport Alpha. I realise that's almost all of them but YEAH I just love them all. Fuck it. The music is perfect. The LOBBY MUSIC alone might just be the best song in the whole game.",
        "I remember my Dad losing his mind about this game because of the plane mechanics - it was the first actual good racing game where you could fly in a plane. Personally I loved the hovercraft the most though. Ugh I also loved the silver coin challenges. I always mained Tip-Tup he was my main man."

Cramorant, Centiscorch, Sinistea, Falinks, Stonjourner, Eiscue, all great. Also I lowkey enjoy Barraskewda. And the dinosaurs are SO UGLY I love it. I also fucking loved the Gigantamax thing, like what were they thinking? Some of the designs are so funny. Very entertaining.",

There is one notable exception though: when you start a gym leader battle in the stadium. HOLY that's a great moment and the music goes hard. But then after a while there's this crowd singing along and it sounds like shit again. But for a minute or two, I was carried away by the excitement."

The undergrowth looks so good, the water looks amazing, and the levels are large and fun and full of stuff. No caves but it doesn't need them!",

Maybe it doesn't have the wild and raw vibes of the first two games but it has a bunch of quality of life changes that make it seem so much less bullshit. The vibes are different but there's still those creepy undertones, especially with that final boss. The music is stunning.",
        "This game also features a hell of a lot of beautifully rendered HD fruit. It's so nice to admire all the fruit at the end of the day. No idea why they went for fruit but it's great. The running out of juice thing is a total joke though."

        "This game totally has its merits: another stunning soundtrack that fits the vibe perfectly being the main one. However it really misses out on a big opportunity: making the player strategise about which pikmin to use. The Pikmin are just available in each level for you to find and use, there's not making your own Pikmin. As a result, you always have the colour you need. Part of the magic of pikmin is selecting your squad and solving puzzles with that, but in this game you just go through the levels and follow the motions. There's not puzzle or strategy really. The minigame between levels is lame, but the bosses are kinda fun!",
        "I would only recommend this to hardcore Pikmin fans. There's not much meat on the bone, and it could have been something so much better. Soundtrack is great though, and I made a mix of it in the music section so check that out."

It's accessible for new players but also great if you're good at it.",

You don't even realise you're upside down most of the time! After many years, I did get bored of those same tracks though. I will also say that those first tracks weren't as great as later ones, but maybe that's because I've just played them to death.",
        "Then, they released some awesome DLC with those banger F-Zero tracks, as well as Animal Crossing, which I love. It was like breathing new life into this old game. Then they went ahead and did it AGAIN, with an insane battle pass which included twice as many tracks. They brought back tons of old favourites, as bunch of surprisingly good city tracks from Mario Kart Tour, and some new ones. I loved it. I love that they went for that. Once again, new life was breathed into it and here we are on a new console 10 years later, still playing it.",

Mario Kart music is already great but they took it to the next level with this OST and I am obsessed. The remixes of old favourites in particular are amazing. In the 'misc' section of this website I actually ranked all of this games tracks, and there are a lot of them, so if you want more detailed thoughts, go check that out."

        "OK I know this game has a bunch of problems but that didn't stop me from loving it with all my heart. Genuinely one of my favourite Fire Emblems! Let's start with the negatives and get them out of the way. The story is ass. All three versions of the game have anticlimactic endings, and do not even attempt to tie up loose ends. Lots of lost potential for an otherwise alright premise. Many of the characters are ridiculous, for example Camilla, who is a sexualised crazy lady who constantly flirts with you (her sibling!). She has this strap of some material that runs between her huge knockers which I can only imagine is super uncomfortable. And she has a hole in her armour to show of her thong. OK I'll shut up about her. Corrin, the main character is the most bland and boring character ever. So plain. FE protagonists tend to be like this but they are the worst by far.",
        "Also what the fuck is going on with the having children in an alternate universe and having them join the team as adults? Who thought of that?? The children mechanic is shamelessly copied from Awakening and they didn't even bother trying to explain it. Whatever, if it means that the fans can flirt with their favourite characters (read: touch Camilla's boobs with the stylus), then it's worth it. This game really is a mess.",
        "Anyway, I love it. The main reason is I think that this soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. It is huge and expansive, and beautifully made. It's honestly gorgeous. The world is split into two, a more folky/celtic vibe in the west and a more oriental vibe in the east, and these two styles are well represented in the music. I love the compositions, especially with the choice of chord progressions. Some faves include Past Light, Dusk Falls, Dark Wastes, Alight, Land Below, Road Token, Glory/Ruin. They are just so good. I made a really good mix of this music, available for download on the music page, which I listen to a lot to this day. It's great for long walks in nature.",
        "I did play all three versions through to the end, which all things considered really is saying something. I really enjoyed the game in terms of its mechanics and strategy. I of course had my favourite characters (Oboro) and my OP characters (Velouria) and it's a delight to pick and choose your main peeps for the team. Ugh what can I say I just really love this game."

In the story you play as the sun god Amaterasu who is reincarnated as an awesome magical wolf, which on its own is sick (twilight princess eat your heart out this came out first!), but then you're taken down this wild rabbit hole of a story based on Japanese folklore.",

When you dramatically run with Kimiko's body to the shrine, when you beat Orochi and realise this game is far from over, those awesome Owl bosses, the snow area in general, shrinking down inside the city, the jiggly boob lady who turns out to not be who you think she is, the gender ambiguous villain character, the final boss. so much to enjoy.",

It becomes tedious and the music slows down. The characters start treating you with hatred and you kill them all one by one. It's designed to be boring and difficult, really testing you if this is really what you want to do. It makes it more and more uncomfortable as you go, and the only real reason to continue is to see all the content in the game, even if that means commiting genocide.

The colours are also very grab and the graphics aren't great. But it doesn't matter because the story is banging and the characters are iconic. I love Nephenee with all my heart and also Ilyana. This is also where we see Buff Ike and his twink boyfriend Soren vibe the hardest. The gay content is right there you just have to look at the screen.",
        "The music is very orchestral and dramatic but I really like it. I love the part in the story when everyone turns to stone and there's a sudden shift in tone."

Like in DS you could play as 5 different babies, but here it's just Baby Mario. And there's so little variety in terms of gameplay and vibes. It's only new mechanic is having big eggs. And then there's this really annoying reveal for the final world where yoshi's island is just a planet. It's just not how I had it in my mind. The music is also disappointing. It has a beautiful title theme but then all the rest is just slight variations of that theme and not in a particularly nice way."

From that point on, it was all about quality of life and making the user feel good. Shovel Knight was the first 'clean' indie game. It felt so good to play and was really well designed.",

There's also adventuring and killing monsters and stuff and that stuff is alright, although I'm more of a builder than a fighter. More of a lover.",

It was so good. I made the mode amazing pixel art and was so proud.

The soundtrack has been remade and it just sounds like shit. The soundfont sounds bad. There are new music tracks for some of the levels, because the original used the same music for multiple levels, but it just doesn't feel right to make those replacements. They got rid of Pirate Lagoon entirely what the fuck.",

They also changed the mechanics, especially of the hovercraft, and it's just worse. I also don't like the new silver coin challenge with the touchscreen, I preferred the old one.

Throughout the game you barkeep at a rundown bar in cyberpunk future, and have a bunch of interesting conversations with the patrons who come in. You also make them drinks but that's just something to keep you occupied.",

The worlds are way too huge and empty. I don't think I completed it in the end. I don't really like the main characters Yooka and Laylee."

After several failed attempts, I got one incredible wonder run where I almost got to the end (having previously beaten the first boss like twice only). I played this one run for ages and everything was hanging on it, and then I lost. I tried to play another one but I could never reach those heights again. I blew it!
