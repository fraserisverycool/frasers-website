        "Decided to start off my year by replaying this absolute banger of a game. I really recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it. It's a timeless and wonderful game which really is more puzzle than action. Samus is a badass, and the vibes of the game are immaculate. She is totally alone on an alien planet and has to deal with a bunch of bullshit and take down this insane monster by herself, and she does it because she's fucking Samus. I really enjoyed reliving the soundtrack, and this time I particularly vibed with the music from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNp-gXZ7hy4\">Phendrana Drifts Depths</a>.",
        "This remake on the Switch is so fucking good. I'm not normally paying attention to performance and technical stuff, but I read that this game is kind of a miracle - it looks insanely good and also runs super smoothly at 60fps. The boys and girls at Retro Studios much be super experts at making video games, and the new Metroid Prime game is definitely gonna be so fucking good. I just need to know what they were working after they finished Donkey Kong Country. It's driving me crazy.",

        "After I fell in love with Void Stranger last year and then found myself drawn to Block Koala no less when playing UFO 50, it finally hit me that I fucking love block puzzle games! Like puzzle games in general are totally my shit and specifically these sukopan-style games slap so hard.",
        "This one is special because there is a whole world full of puzzles that you can walk around freely. If a puzzle is too difficult, you can just find something else to do and come back to it. This is great most of the time, but this game does have power ups which make certain puzzles possible, and sometimes when I'm tackling a tough puzzle I doubt myself whether I'm just too dumb to solve it, or if I actually need to collect a power-up from somewhere else first. It's led to a couple of moments of frustration, but it's totally forgivable given how good the puzzles are.",

        "What made the original, Crypt of the Necrodancer, so special was that it was something entirely new, a dungeon crawling roguelike rhythm game. Fucking sick. So when I saw this sequel I was sceptical because it's just a plain old rhythm game. Nonetheless I like me a rhythm game and it's a been a while so I got it and it's so good. This might be the most polished rhythm game I've ever played.",
        "It's hard as nails, but also so reasonable! The timings are forgiving, and there's this system where you lose health if you get hit by an incoming monster, so if you don't press the right button in time. But if you press the wrong button at any given point, you don't lose health, instead you lose your combo. So it means that you can kind of mash on the difficult bits, and at first this bothered me, but it just means that you can get through the levels without dying, just with a low score. So you can kinda play the game how you want, going for the high score or not. Going for the high score is insanely difficult but those leaderboards are tempting me, that's for sure.",
        "When I accidentally started a song on hard mode near the start, I was so shook. You're meant to be able to follow all that?? But by the end of playing through the story, I got so good at the game. Things which seemed impossible like those jumping harpies, I've totally got down now. I just needed to practice them and the songs they come in. I've since gone through and beaten (almost) everything on hard mode and it feels great. It feels so good to get good at the game, and this game lets you do that. The progression through the track is pretty great for that.",
        "There are some other things like minigames and bosses, but they're nothing compared to the actual core gameplay, it's all about the normal rhythm game stuff. I will say there is a really cool thing in 'remix mode' which randomises the monsters, so you kinda have serious replayability. And the difficulty levels will keep you going for a long time.",
        "I will admit, in terms of vibes, there is another rhythm game which has this beat: Everhood. Everhood had an actually fascinating story, lots of funny and wacky nonsense and all around great vibes. This game is far more generic in terms of presentation, and the story is actually a joke. I would have loved some funny writing. But at least the music is good! I didn't love the heavy metal tracks because I'm just not a fan of the genre, but also because they tended to be too fast, making reactions really hard. But most of the tracks were delightful. Personal favourites were from 'Sam Webster' and 'Nick Nausbaum'."

The game features two characters who develop a friendship throughout the game and I imagine they thought it would a great way for people to bond while playing the game. I don't think achieves it though. Firstly because the game has a 3D camera, a double jump and a air-dash, and multitasking - it's hard for people who don't know how to play games. Secondly because the vibes are off. Let's talk about the vibes.",
        "The premise is good: two female writers are trapped in their own made-up stories and have to escape. It's both sci-fi and fantasy and the worlds are great. Actually there are tons of great ideas in general, especially in terms of gameplay mechanics. But the two characters are so insufferable it hurts. One of them is happy-go-lucky and the other is sarcastic and rude. And as I learned playing the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, it drives me insane to see characters who have no social skills. This bitch Mio is so rude it blew me away. You are literally trapped in a fantasy land with a stranger and you don't take a moment to appreciate your never-seen-before surroundings or the fact that magic exists and just talk about it! If I were Zoe I would be pissed.",

The bonding on the couch really becomes laughing at the game instead of laughing with the game very quickly. For a game with so many great ideas, it's a shame they put no time into the story. Also there is absolutely no lesbian energy."

It's definitely not the kind of game I would willingly buy, although I do have an appreciation for the Wii-era Nintendo Mii vibe, and I did play Tomodachi Life back then on the DS.",
        "This game is totally fucked up and I cannot recommend it in good conscious. It's a turn based RPG, although there is little to no strategy, and all the characters fight on their own, not really requiring your input. Playing this game you quickly realise it's not about gameplay, it's about the relationships between all the Miis you create. They all have little personalities and are very sassy with one another, early animal crossing style. I have it say, it's funny as fuck. I can really imagine this being hilarious if you take mushrooms. The sheer amount of nonsense is just insane.",
        "I spent a ridiculous amount of time at the start of the game making a bunch of high quality Miis, and realised that there are so many NPCs in the game, and you can make Miis for them all. I just felt invested because these Miis were all so good, I couldn't just drop the game, even if there isn't really a game here. So I would progress, and every now and then, another one of my horrible creations would turn up and it would just be hilarious.",

Luckily, the horse that you befriend some ways into the game broke up the fight.",

You have to understand, this isn't just any old collection of NES/arcade-style games, these are all brand-new games! They've been developed with modern game design philosophy and ALL of the games are bangers. All 50 of them!",

Each of them bring something new to the table, to the point where most of them could be expanded into their own indie games and they would be fucking great. Inevitably, not every game will be for everyone, but that's the beauty of UFO 50 - everyone can find something that suits their tastes in there, and everyone will also end up trying out different kinds of games that they would otherwise never touch.",

I got so into block koala and although I recognise why most people wouldn't rate the game very high, I totally clicked with it and very quickly 100%ed it. Camouflage was another banger puzzle game, so good.",

It's also absolutely drowned in secrets, lore, amazing characters, twists and turns, and 10/10 music.",

The first and most important thing to talk about is the insane glow-up that the soundtrack got. It has truly gotten the Origami King treatment and I mean that in the best possible way. They've added new tracks, new variations of existing tracks, and boldly updated the old favourites which is almost always tasteful and successful. The battle theme has multiple variations depending on the region you're in and it's touches like that which turn a good game into a special game. You're in a mysterious off-colour forest and run into an enemy? Consider the vibe MATCHED.",
        "I will say that they added an Erhu (a very recognisable Chinese string instrument) to the Glitz pit music and it honestly sounds a bit off. In my opinion they should have gone for more of a lucha libre/WWE vibe but whatever it still sounds good.",

Gameplay-wise they nerfed Power Bounce which thinking about it is probably a good thing. Some of the later boss battles can't be cheesed with it anymore.",

Gameplay-wise I did think to myself, this game is just like the others. But that's not a bad thing, it's a great formula.",

There are some genuinely horrible & creepy moments. The first time you see the SA-X, or when you encounter a certain someone encased in ice, the introduction of one of the bosses towards the end where you first see its corpse... It's so good. Terrifying. The music really adds to it as well.",

It still left many things open in many cases so I still felt super smart finding my way around a lot of the time. There were like two points where I had to look up the answer because to be fair it was completely ridiculous. This one hole you have to find in the water sector is just so dumb, and the comments on the youtube video which shows the whole made me feel better about looking it up."

You have 13 whole-ass protagonists who all have intricately interconnected lives and stories, and you get to follow all their journeys in any order you like. Octopath Traveler, eat your heart out! Unlike that stiff storytelling with 8 entirely separate stories, hear all the characters interact and it is so exciting. I admit that it relies on some of those classic anime tropes a lot, but I allow it because the actual story is so wild and unpredictable. It's got all these great plot twists and because you decide what order to learn about them, discovering them makes it feel like YOU figured it out, or that you stumbled onto some juicy information that you shouldn't have found already. Delicious.",

But it didn't take long for me to understand that that is crucial to the vibe of the environment. The sound design is super good even without the music - there is so much going on in terms of water dripping sounds, ambient noises, squelchy sounds as you move, it makes it all sound so real. And without the music it does give it that lonely metroid vibe. And on the occasions where music does play, it hits hard because of it. Interesting choice and although I'm a little upset because I'm sure a game with this vibe and colour scheme would have a beautiful twinkly soundtrack, I understand that not having music goes a long way to set this game apart from all the other super similar metroidvanias.",

It's got some very creative power-ups which are delightful, and focuses more on puzzle solving than combat, which I personally really appreciate. But there's another game which this clearly takes lots of inspiration from: Fez. Fez is this puzzler (also with a strong vibe) which you play through once, then it slowly dawns on you, that was just the beginning, and you are assaulted with many higher-level meta puzzles which turn the whole game on its head. Tunic was kinda similar too. Animal Well has the same thing going for it - you beat the game, and realise huh, there's more to it than this... you start digging and keep digging, and by the time you've reached some of the “deeper” parts of the well, you've already made a whole bunch of notes and are starting to go a bit crazy.

        "I loved this game, specifically the second one as a child playing on the GBA. I got into this way before becoming a Fire Emblem fan! It took a bit of time for me to pick it up because I genuinely thought it would be crap. I thought the gameplay would have aged badly and the new look isn't exactly that appealing, but I'm totally hooked again!",
        "Gameplay-wise this is super fun. It's super satisfying to go for a specific strategy and see it pay off. One-shotting units with bombers or submarines or medium tanks... man there's nothing better. I will say though that it's tough! And the enemy AI has pulled off some genius shit. One gripe I do have is that some of the later battles with lots of bases and cities tend to go on for ages... I'm not finished playing the game as I'm writing this, but the map pictured below took me all afternoon. I have some strong memories of the end of the second game, so I guess I have that to look forward to next...",
        "Vibes-wise this game has a super weird direction. It's war but it also feels like playfighting between kids. The toy-box aesthetics and comically extreme characters really laugh in the face of the horrors of war. I'm not trying to criticise the game for this, it's just jarring! It's not trying to make any points about war or even tell a good story, it's just trying to be a banger strategy game, which it is. The soundtrack is a bop too - all the old themes I loved from back then, remade and with special individual tracks for when you activate your CO power (a much needed change)."

It's the colours you see first thing when you wake up in the morning when you're still woozy and coming to. It reminds me of this game I played as a child “Zool 2” in terms of vibe. Something very special!",
        "I do feel like the character of Penny is a bit random. Her design is just a bunch of elements thrown together and doesn't have so much of a personality. There is some missed potential there, especially with the “big breakaway” part of the game. It doesn't feel like you're running away, but rather like you're going through some levels. If it were me, I would have gone for Penny running away constantly, with animations reflecting her fear/excitement, kinda like in Pizza Tower.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun, it's a momentum game kinda like Sonic, which makes sense because it's from the same devs as Sonic Mania (one of the best games ever). And by the end of the game I kinda got it with the loop, dash and jump moves. At the start though it was really hard, and I kept hitting walls and being bad and it was frustrating. I didn't feel the need to replay levels and do them better.",
        "One thing about the game is that you can choose whether you go through slowly and find all the collectibles and unlock difficult levels, go for mega points by having a big combo, or speedrunning. Different strokes for different folks but I was totally unsure about what I wanted! I wish I could have been told what to do in that regard, but that's just me.",
        "One last thing: I regret playing this on the switch. The graphics and framerate are bad and not in a good way. When I watched some gameplay from the PC version after finishing the game I was so shook!"

        "My neighbour Fab and I enjoy playing indie games together when we hang out and this year we played a visual novel called Harold Halibut which he had on his gamepass. It was a nice time! The main thing to note about it is the stop motion/clay animation style. It gives it a vibe of being somewhat of a parody, like Team America or something. It means even the serious parts you have to enjoy with a smile. This combined with some honestly excellent dialogue makes for a delightful little experience.",
        "You play as a very plain and boring person who has a heart of gold, and he is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades handyman on a spaceship that is stuck in the sea of an alien world. All his colleagues speak down at him but in a loving way, and it's fun to see him deal with that. It's presented in a way that he might be depressed, but then he does find pleasure in the little interactions, because there are many delightful little quirks in the story to enjoy. After some twists in the story, you can see how his outlook changes, and it's handled quite maturely.",
        "It's got a nice little soundtrack, a lovely setting, and great characters. I really recommend it, although not if you're looking for a game. This is a visual novel through and through, you will only be pressing A!"

        "This is just the same as slay the spire. Instead it's got cute animals and great dialogue. One thing really nice about it is you play as three characters at once and get access to all three of their card decks, which means it's fun to pick and choose what you want.",

        "It was fun learning what was really broken in the game and what could be ignored. Like in slay the spire, card draw is super important, but in this game not so much - I would say energy is way more important. Also, movement is far more powerful than shielding. Pretty cool."

        "This game is so kooky and fun, and made with love. It has a great art direction, and fantastic characters. You play a larger man who dives in a special location which contains all the fish in the world and then sells them as sushi. It's a wild premise and one that I really enjoy. I love that you just get real life fish and literally everything can be eaten. Even the bosses are just sharks and shit (for the most part).",
        "Dave the character is just great, he is often sidelined and people are kinda rude to him but he just takes it in his stride. He loves what he does and has a great positive mindset and you just love to see it. He's surrounded by some other amazing characters, like the sushi chef. Their little dialogues are always great, and all the characters are beautifully characterised by these amazing short pixel art cutscenes. They are SUCH a pleasure to watch always.",
        "Going diving and catching new fish is also super fun. First time to see and catch a shark? Awesome. And the sushi restaurant parts are also great. They're super satisfying and making more and more money each day just feels so good.",
        "But I don't think I'd recommend this game to friends, because it is just sooooo slow. Diving in general is slow, and the story progresses really slowly. There are a million side quests, including this eco-app where you are encouraged to collect certain items. You get so little out of these quests, but I found myself obsessively getting everything all the time. It's meant to be a relatively chill game but I found myself optimising and making sure I could complete everything, which resulted in a bunch of super long dives.",
        "As the game goes on, it continuously piles on new mechanics, minigames, stuff that is clearly designed to keep you interested, as the core gameplay of shooting your harpoon at fish will get old quick. That's cool and all but by the end you have so much shit on, that it's almost overwhelming. I spent more time farming, transferring fish from the fish farm, asking myself which recipes I wanted to upgrade, playing these dumb phone minigames than actually diving. They just cram the game full of new content, and it's not even good. Like each new mechanic is so shallow that it gets old very quickly.",
        "This fucking phone game which is like tamagotchi was what did it for me. Like why am I spending my time on this. They literally give you a phone that you can check for all the various game content, including a sushi version of instagram, and you end up just staring at it for ages. I truly don't think this game is a comment on how we are addicted to our phones. I just think they put too much shit into the game and it got boring. This would have been way better on a smaller scale in my opinion."

        "I've got a lot to say about this one so buckle up. As an enjoyer of the original FF7 and... I think I was an enjoyer of the previous game (Final Fantasy VII Remake), I felt the desire to play this game too. But I've been shocked by how horrifically sanitised it is. I think Remake was much the same but here it's even more so! I realised pretty quickly during this game that I'm not actually playing a game, I'm playing a product. I'm being served content and I'm supposed to enjoy it. After all this is a triple AAA big budget game that I paid full price for, and consumers like me have certain expectations. So the game gives me open world, generous dollops of fan-service, a whole ass card game, one thousand million mini games, a whole bunch of playable characters (including big seph), orchestral remixes of beloved old songs...",
        "It just all feels so forced! You can't escape it. Sure, this game has magic and love but it all stems from the very strong base of the original game. The world of FF7 is so fucking cool, with the world being overtaken by an energy company after they monopolise a new environment-destroying energy source. It's so topical, I love it. Seriously, play the original, it still holds up today and tells such a cool story about this fascinating world (a whole-ass planet, by the way). Rebirth isn't bad as such because it's built on this base. But what it adds is either annoying, superfluous or made without love.",
        "The worst offender is the open world. Don't get me wrong, I really don't mind an open world. But this one is less of an open world and more of a to-do list of pointless tasks in a big area. I have to go to the various spots and complete menial tasks in order to get a rush of dopamine as it is ticked off. Most aggravating for me was Chadley, the AI robot child character who sends Cloud off to do these super scripted “I'm playing a video game” tasks. Go defeat these monsters, go take a photo here, go activate this tower. What do I actually get out of this? Luckily I'm not actually invested enough in the gameplay to be interested in the materia you get from Chadley.",
        "One thing the open world does do is give the sense that you're exploring the whole planet. And I have to say it looks quite nice. The various towns all look fantastic as well. This is really a feast for the eyes, especially for those who played the original. Seeing Costa del Sol, Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon all looking so good is a treat. There are also lush, orchestral versions of the original soundtrack in these places, which is delightful.",
        "But while I'm talking about the soundtrack, I have to say that it's all over the place. The general vibe appears to be orchestral, but then it throws in the wacky stuff (certain sidequests, chocobo music, moogles, cactuars...) and the music goes all electronic and wild. There is also gratuitous jazz music here and there, and other random shit depending on what's going on. It feels like they're just cramming in as much content as possible. This is a recurring theme.",
        "Similar topic, this game switches from serious to silly so casually, it's jarring. The chocobos really are completely ridiculous! And there's something about seeing them in HD which makes it even wilder. In the OG, things happen so quickly and switch themselves up so regularly and you don't even bat an eyelid if you need to ride a chicken through the swamp. The vibe is so strong that silly things can coexist with the serious main story. In this remake, the silly, cartoonish things simply look so out of place, I can't take anything seriously.",
        "Two of the main characters (Red 13 and Cait Sith, my fave from the OG) are so outlandish in this game that it takes away any hopes of seriousness when they're involved. Actually despite that, I'm super happy with how they did Cait Sith because that really isn't easy to translate from the PS1 version and he looks and sounds great. Red 13 though, god the thing with his voice in Cosmo Canyon is so dumb, and he doesn't have any personality apart from that. He was way cooler in the OG I can't even describe. As for the other characters, Aerith and Barret are fine, they're both delightful. Tifa I can't even say anything because any semblance of a personality is completely eclipsed by her humongous knockers. Those badockadonks have their own field of gravity they are that huge. Whenever she's on screen I can't help but make an out-loud comment about how needlessly massive her tits are. Yuffie is beautifully animated, but her outfit from the original really needed an update. She's really a ninja, and trying to make a sleeveless, crop-top, turtlenecked, knitted woollen jumper work.",
        "The worst offender though is Cloud. God I hate how useless he is in social situations. They made him stand-offish and distant so that he looks like a badass, but to me he's just a dickhead. Aerith is trying so hard to make conversation and she is just suffering because Cloud just leaves her on read constantly. And somehow, the group all still tolerate him, nay revere him?? He literally does bad spoiler thing in the Gongaga reactor and Tifa is like, you good Cloud no worries babe. AT LEAST Cloud has some decent sexual tension with Sephiroth, who spends 80% of his screen time just glaring. I'm kinda into that.",
        "That was a lot of words about the vibe of the game, here's my review of the gameplay: The battle system in the game is really good. It took me a while to get into it (I'd forgotten everything from the previous game) but it's satisfying and fun. I also enjoy the Queen's Blood card game a lot. It's cool that there aren't any loading screens."

In this game it's possible to fuse monsters together and they straight up made designs and names for every single combination (and there are over 100 of the things!). That alone is an incredible achievement and I was thoroughly enjoying seeing new combinations of my favourite mons even at the end of the game. However, there are so many of them that their specialness does kinda wear off after a while.",

This game is glitchier than the newer Pokemon games which is impressive and the crazy loading screens and bad graphics is just on a different level. Normally I'm not too much of a bitch when it comes to this stuff, but it negatively affects the vibe of the game and is impossible to ignore. I can't recommend the game for that alone.",
        "One good thing was the open world aspect, you can go to any area whenever, which is great for catching cool mons. The worst thing about Pokemon (Well maybe not but for me a super annoying thing) is not being able to get a team of your faves early on in the game. All my faves are late game Pokemon and I'm pissed about that. The best thing about Pokemon is curating a team of my favourite mons and giving them all the love and attention that they deserve, watching them grow and beating the game with them. In cassette beasts I was able to find my faves (of course the dumbest designs ever, and this game has plenty of goofy ass mons that I'm immediately drawn to) and I was also able to swap them out easily because the levelling up is based on your character, not your mons, a great idea.",

It's based on a pretty interesting mechanic of swinging on your tongue, where you use momentum and timing to propel yourself through hand-crafted levels. It's something that you can get better at and is really satisfying when you get right. Many of the puzzles are based on timing jumps and letting go of your tongue at the precise moment when you will fly at just the right angle, which requires a good spatial understanding.",

Celeste somehow manages to find the sweetspot between “this is kinda easy” and “this is bullshit”, presumably through a hell of a lot of playtesting. Tongue Tale doesn't manage to do that (sorry Remke). The first world is a lot of fun, but somewhere in the second or third world the difficulty spikes so insanely quickly into the “this is bullshit” realm that it kinda detracts from the experience.

This game is equally as bad as the first game, except it has more stuff in it!\n",
        "However, I have to hand it to them for making this game real. Having such a ridiculously convoluted story, bewildering cameos from disney characters and final fantasy characters just hanging out. Incredible that it happened. I can imagine that at the time, this game would have been so fucking crazy.",
        "The game features so many cameos it's actually ridiculous. All the stories and worlds are short and shallow so they can fit in more content. I think the appeal is more like “wow I am riding Aladdin's magic carpet” rather than “this carpet minigame is fun”.",
        "One thing I appreciate about Kingdom Hearts is the stilted dialogue, which leads to the funniest cutscenes ever. I watched a “kingdom hearts” out of context video and it had me cackling. The comedic timing on some of the nonsense that the characters spout really does tickle me.",
        "I admit, I didn't engage with the battle system as much as I could have. I played on normal mode and mashed X to get through the game. Only at the very end of the game I realised you could increase your ability points by using items. In the final world I had a ridiculously difficult boss fight (Roxas) where the game suddenly turned into Elden Ring and I had to spend two hours increasing my level and learning his attack patterns. I was utterly unprepared and it didn't feel good to have to learn how to play the game then to beat him. In my defence, the player has to put in a lot of work to understand how stuff works. I'm used to modern games where things are properly explained.",
        "Well, I beat the game, which is saying something, I guess."

        "Using the last ounce of my fading strength, I launched into the next game in the collection, a prequel spinoff which follows three new characters. This game has even more battle systems than usual, and I was punished pretty quickly for not engaging with them. I managed to get quite far, but at some point it became clear that I would have to grind levels, and level up these commands, and worse, in order to do so, I would have to play a mario party-style minigame. I noped out of that, finally took a step to preserve my health and sanity, and put kingdom hearts down forever."

        "This game blew me away. Very hard to describe what it's about but here we go. You start the game inside an egg and you have to be born, but not before you get some kind of seed implanted inside of you. You are tasked by what appears to be a religious entity (the Centre) to rid the world of dust and bring about the Anodyne, something like a rapture (the word “anodyne” means painkiller). As you go around removing the evil dust, the seed inside you watches as you do your job. The evil dust affects the citizens of the weird and wonderful world, and you remove it, numbing the pain and “clarifying” things for them.",
        "As you go through the game, doing your job and meeting all these suffering people, you realise the game relates a lot to the human experience. There are many points in the game where you can draw parallels to how we grow up, how our parents affect us, our relationship with entities like “the Centre”, and many many other things. The game is dripping with meaning.",
        "It also has an immaculate vibe. The world looks like a PS1 game, polygons and everything, but it also has nice lighting. The colour palette makes it look dreamy. It also looks dumb and trashy and low budget and I love that. There are also some 2D sections for when you shrink down to a miniscule size in order to clean the dust, and they are delightful. If you're interested, give <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SnkLnlsnY\">this track from an opening area</a> a listen"

        "I love Pikmin with my whole heart. There's something special about it. The combination of the focus on nature, the soundtrack, the wacky characters, and the kinda dark elements combine to give it a certain X factor which is hard to pin down with words. When I think about whether games are good, they can get approval from me for a variety of reasons. Like Slay the spire is just great gameplay. But most of my favourite games just have great vibes.",
        "The vibe of pikmin is so fucking strong that it's insane, and the gameplay is good enough that it's fun to spend time in the game soaking up the vibe. The first pikmin arguably had the worst gameplay but the strongest vibe. The time limit, as well as harshness of the environment, and some highlights like the first encounters with specific bosses. Lots of bullshit with pikmin killing themselves, general difficulty. It is a great time and might be my favourite pikmin.",
        "The second pikmin game is a lot bigger and also has vibes in spades. The areas are super nice, music is fantastic (I love the piklopedia), and gameplay significantly improved with having two captains. The caves seemed pretty random though - like time stops when you're down there and then you've just got this ability to go back to the previous floor if you lose too many pikmin. I feel like it takes away from the general feeling of the game, and it's more like bonus content.",
        "Pikmin 3 is super interesting. It's fucking gorgeous, has beautiful areas and possibly the best music of all. It also does away with the caves, and instead just has a really big overworld, which brings back that pikmin 1 vibe a lot. I never liked how the treasures were just fruits though, that seemed pointless. It also added mission mode, which was the best thing ever in terms of gameplay - these super fun little challenge modes. The final boss was also very special.",
        "Now after 10 years we finally get Pikmin 4 and I have been excited for it, even more so than for Zelda. In terms of gameplay, everything is there. Quality of life changes to the max, meaning that pikmin actually do what they're told, all the pikmin content you could wish for. All the old bosses coming back, caves, hours of gameplay. I had a fun time collecting all the treasures and completing everything.",
        "But something's off. The game feels like a huge collection of content being thrown in. More is more! The caves are more content, the dandori challenges (like pikmin 3 mission mode) are great but integrated into the game like extra content. They brought back the (terrifying in pikmin 2) waterwraith and it felt empty. It just dropped two of them in the final dungeon. Doing that really takes away the special vibe of that particular boss. I realised that in pikmin 4, vibe was sacrificed for more content, and that this is true for many games these days.",
        "The quality of life changes &amp; powered up rewind function makes it so it's very easy to get through the game without losing pikmin, so stakes are way lower now. I think I miss the chaos of the first two pikmins where one misstep can cause your whole squad to get flattened without warning. Electricity immediately killing them, the gatling groinks, yellows throwing bombs back at you. There's something delicious about that.",
        "On top of that, the music isn't so great. The Olimar sidequest tracks are great, but otherwise it's gone a different direction: now it has ultra adaptive music (something the series is famous for and a big contributor to the X factor) but it's so adaptive to the point it's barely recognisable. There are multiple layers which fade in and out depending on what enemy you're fighting, what you're carrying etc. Nothing you can hum.",
        "They also retconned the lore, and it was \"all a dream\" or something. They had Louie be the bad guy but then cleared things up after, and there were no open questions left like in Pikmin 2. There was no weird shit like the Pikmin 3 final boss. And final complaint: I wish they integrated the night time/glow pikmin sections better.",
        "But to end on a positive, I really loved getting platinum medals in the dandori challenges, and those final ones were tough as nails. I still loved this game. I even painted a picture of Oatchi for my living room!"

        "Playing this game felt a lot like playing Breath of the Wild back in 2017, although it has to be said: nothing can truly recreate that feeling of magic we all felt back then. It's undeniably a better game, but some of that magic is gone the second time around. It's super interesting because it's forcing me to reflect on why I enjoyed playing BotW more, despite it being emptier and more annoying. How we enjoy games really depends on so many things, not just the game itself. In this case, it was because there really wasn't anything like it before.",

Actually I wondered if it was a little too over-engineered, taking away the magic a bit. But I couldn't deny that the little game design things they implemented were all great. Things like old paths closing off if it's definitely the wrong way to go, or pleasant music playing when you start solving a puzzle in the right way."

I didn't have to reset when someone got hit with a critical hit! I should have used this option the whole time. To balance it out, I also played on hard mode, which made the game more fun, although I was resentful that my playtime extended very long because of it.

Sea of stars has just such a great vibe. I really enjoy the character designs and the environments and the lighting especially. There's an ability that lets you change the time of day and it looks soooo good, I've never seen anything like it.",

The battle system is a lot of fun, especially with the timed inputs and breaking of opponent's big moves, and I never groaned when I had a battle. However it doesn't have too much depth. It takes a long time before the characters learn any new attacks and when they do, they're never gamechanging. In fact I spent all the game using moonerang because it's simply the strongest attack. On top of that, one of the moves 'disorient' can really be abused to stop bosses ever doing their strong attack, which resulted in me missing all exciting animations from the final boss, which was a bit lame.",

They have no personality, they just go around winning battles and solving problems like boring heroes. How did they survive 10 years of isolation and training and then become perfectly well rounded heroes? The previous solstice warriors ended up not being well-rounded at all. The other characters are also pretty plain, with the exception of Resh'an, which was a genuine pleasant surprise. I appreciate that there was little dialogue, because it gave off those old fashioned SNES vibes, but it did mean that there was little to no character development. It's a shame because I like the designs.",
        "When it comes to world building, I have a couple of questions. If we're dealing with multiple timelines and universes, why are we just focusing on two of them? How did we end up consistently going between these two specifically using the vast sea of stars? Considering the name of the game is sea of stars, the whole concept isn't very well explored. I mean we got this insane, super cool warp sequence there, but even though we traverse the sea multiple times, we never see that again.",

        "In conclusion, this is a game which does have that X factor which is so rare in the wealth of video games we are bombarded with these days, but it has some things holding it back from being one of my favourites. I did push through all 30 hours though, which says something"

She is just all over the map and all she does is hate on Gruntilda. It is so funny and I love the energy. Sometimes she's hiding in a corner somewhere and just pops up to say that Gruntilda is disgusting because she eats maggots for breakfast. Sets me off everytime.",

The music is really good though, but of course I would say that as a lover of Donkey Kong 64 (proven to be a terrible game).",

You have to get lucky with the pills, because there isn't a good strategy for what to do when you get the wrong pills. You have to constantly go for vertical rows of 4 because the horizontal ones are just so risky.",

She is such a bitch I hate her so much.",

It's a wonder that any of these characters get anything done because they don't know how to communicate at all.",

That shit was also bullshit, just like the main game, and there were fewer opportunities to cheese opponents. Still, I did it. Beating Ansem at the end was really hard but I did it.

The first area looks so stunning with the cloudy stormy sky over the lit-up landscape, and the magical elements of the huge golden trees. This world was created with a vision and I appreciate that.",
        "But the game has multiple barriers of entry. There's Margit, who I of course had no chance against. Luckily, a friend told me about a quest I should do somewhere near the beginning, and that was great because I got a +8 spear out of it, which made me super powerful. I also enjoyed using the spear at a weapon. I used that spear to get me through Margit and also two other big bosses.",
        "Rennala was a huge struggle, even though the vibes of her magic academy and boss fight in general were immaculate, because the +8 spear was no longer enough to carry me through the game. I managed to finally beat her and I did feel that sense of accomplishment that Dark Souls fans don't shut up about, but when I realised that I need to learn how to either upgrade the spear or start with another weapon, and also when I realised that I invested my levelled up stats all wrong, I lost interest.",
        "The second barrier of entry is learning the stats and mechanics of the game, and that shit is not well communicated in the game. I feel like you need to have the implicit knowledge from previous FromSoft games or a friend to teach you this stuff. Or you spend ages reading the wiki, which for me a red flag when it comes to video games.",

But this one is just so MUCH! There are 6 characters all screaming out their catchphrases constantly, and there's so much going on that I can't concentrate. Sometimes I start a fight and have to put the switch down because it's all too much.",

And those characters are just all so loud. I do kinda like the characters this time round though, especially Eunie, who is a total babe.",

Fastforward to today and I'm on like level 10 smash, playing in competitive tournaments. Now it's all about specific match up knowledge, having a gameplan and changing your gameplan mid-game. It's about mind games and understanding what your opponent will do. It's an actual fighting game and it turns out I'm super into that.

I love that she has the float mechanic, which makes her able to move unlike any other character. It also means she has a very good disadvantage, so I don't have to be frustrated about not being able to get back to stage. Early smash ultimate days I even got some great results with her, but that's because she was a monster in the early meta.

Looking back, I appreciate that it's not in the mushroom kingdom and that there are worlds based on countries in real life. And also Daisy is the princess here, not Peach!"

        "I can't believe the first mario kart looked like this! They split the screen like this on the fucking super nintendo and straight up made a 3d game. Insane! The game itself is hard as balls but you can kinda get good at it if you keep at it. Some of these tracks are legendary, and I love it when they get remade in the newer mario kart games, it's just deeply satisfying.",
        "I also have to shout out the soundtrack. Like 6 of the tracks is latin-inspired music! Salsa in things like Choco Island and Samba in Donut Plains, it's everywhere you listen. I love it! And of course this is where a brand new genre of music was invented: Rainbow Road music. Is there anything like it?"

This game is boring as fuck, and there's no end. At some point I gave up and let myself die because it didn't become any more difficult. Would not recommend to a friend. But I'm satisfied to have played a game featuring the character from smash Mr Game and Watch."

I remember thinking, I just need to do a few more runs, then I can finally unlock all the stuff, but they kept releasing new stuff so quickly that I couldn't keep up. I became obsessed with just getting all the unlockables long after I stopped having fun with the game. In the end, this game taught me to never play mobile games again. Fuck games like this with predatory pricing systems and addictive gameplay loops. They're not even good."

It was so cool growing my plants and visiting all my facebook friends' farms to get rewards. I got hooked. Eventually though, more and more people at school quit it because they saw it for what it really was: a soulless money making scheme. I eventually got the memo and deleted it, but not before I spend 5 pounds on a decorative tea house for my farm. Why the fuck did I do that? It was an eye opening moment that really turned me off of games with microtransactions forever after."
